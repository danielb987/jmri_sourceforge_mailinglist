Dick, Respectively have to disagree with your oil change analogy.  Considerinstead the case of a mechanic needing to add 1 quart of oil into 3different vehicles that are each more than 1 quart low! J  There is noreason to throttle the fill rate in this case.  Here is a scenario I haverun into.  Suppose JMRI or a loconet device has 5 switch requests to sendand then logix or input events result in 5 sensor reports to send.  I'd liketo get to the sensor reports as soon as possible, but for various reasons donot want to have to shuffle the order of the messages.  The command stationcan buffer up 5 switch requests without a Long ACK so I want to send them atfull speed and then get the sensor reports out.  In your scenario, the 5switch requests would be slowed down so the sensor reports will always besent later than needed?

I am only proposing that we throttle switchcommands to a rate that can be dealt with by the command station, so thereshouldn't be any actual slow down of the DCC data stream. If you wait untilthe buffer does over run, then you have a lost packet to deal with. Think ofit like putting oil into your engine with a funnel. If you pour into thefunnel too fast it overflows and some oil winds up on your valve cover to becleaned up later. As long as you don't pour too fast into the funnel, theneverything goes smoothly and no oil is lost, and no cleanup is required.Saying that we should run as fast as possible is like telling your mechanicto always pour the oil as fast as he can until the funnel overflows, then tokeep pouring fast enough that it dribbles over the edge.When you are sending out commands destined for DCC devices you have the sametrouble. At least you are waiting for things to quiet down before making anyfurther attempt to resend the missed data. What JMRI winds up doing ispouring in the oil faster. If anything, JMRI should put the retry of thefailed packet to the head of the queue, and then set the delay longer for ashort time, to give the oil in the funnel time to go down a bit beforesending again. JMRI does not have the same problem because it has hardware handshaking andbuffering. Of course if some LocoNet device tries to over run theLocoBuffer-USB it can, but only if JMRI isn't running or is hung up for somereason. The LocoBuffer-USB talks to JMRI at 57,600 so it can easily playcatchup when cleaning out any buffered data.I'm not proposing the elimination of retries entirely, just that there be anoption for disabling them when the cure is worse than the disease. I.e.every LocoNet system with no DCC accessory decoders, which is probably themajority of them.Dick :)

B.,Good info.  That would work for my own layout, but from a product standpointI have to support a mix of loconet-only and dcc-only stationary decoders(QuadLN and Quad boards) so the switch requests need to get to the DCC side.Regards,Robin-----Original Message-----From: B.

Hi all,Anyone know of any problems with my adding the following line of codeto apps.AppsBase.InstallManagers()?  * InstanceManager.store(new jmri.NamedBeanHandleManager(),jmri.NamedBeanHandleManager.class);*I've tested the change and it doesn't seem to hurt anything, but I wantedto check to see if it was left out of that function intentionally.  Thereare several other store()s in that routine.Please advise,  SteveT

Couple comments: Just a thought here - do we really want to throttle switch requests all thetime?  It seems like it is desirable in general to burst out routes, etc asquickly as possible.  Maybe the throttling should occur only after a LongACK is seen, and then only for a finite time period? Turning off retries might be ok for some special cases.  However I have todeal with systems where loconet-only (non-dcc) devices are originatingswitch requests to (legacy) non-loconet stationary decoders.  JMRI (vialocobuffer) is often in the same boat, yes?  If we want to be sure thatthose switch requests get through (and I think we do), it seems like we needa solution that encompasses retries?

I've seen these 'storms' now and then when systems are trying to startup. On some combinations of PC horsepower, layout size, etc... this can mean a minute or so before things settle down.If the idea of the LONG_ACK is that things are not well on the other end, I could see slowing down our output rate. Something like if we get that, we chop the speed (half??) until we get something sent without the LONG_ACK coming back. Or whatever tells us that the system/network isn't keeping up. And this should impact the whole queue so the order isn't impacted.I think our real quandary is we've tried to be responsive and do things like retry of commands. But really what we should be doing is trying a command and then if the feedback doesn't change (in whatever timing we said that should take) then we would try again. In the meantime we know our status is 'Inconsistent' since the commanded state isn't what the feedback says it is. But this would have two bad side effects: one break lots of otherwise happy layouts, two require lots of feedback where layouts have been without it. Ok, Dick would sell more hardware, but I don't think that's the idea here.I'd agree that this is likely a sticky thing that raises its head now and then and we may have the "dammed if we do, dammed if we don't" so trying to pick the right solution is far from clear or simple.-ken cameronSyracuse Model Railroad Club http://www.SyracuseModelRr.org/ CNY Modelers   cnymod.comFinger Lakes Live Steamers http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org/ Member JMRI Developer Team http://www.jmri.org/ mailto: kcameron@...

Walt,What happens if you try to load a panel when the track power is off? Maybe it would be better to just ignore any errors if the power is off...... on the other hand if your signals are being driven by DCC commands and you ignore the errors, then they wouldn't initialize correctly. ........I don't think that there is any 100% 'correct' answer to this when the system is event driven and peer-peer. See what unintended consequences there are from an idea as simple as 'the turnout command failed, lets send it again'. In the first place we don't really know that it failed to do what was intended, and have absolutely no way to ever know that. All we actually know is that some part of the system (in this case the command station) was not able to do everything it normally would with the command. The layout system may very well not care that the command station was not able to create a DCC command to match the original LocoNet command. How is that fundamentally any different than a turnout point that fails to move when it is commanded because it is jammed by a piece of ballast, or a loco that doesn't respond to a command because it is sitting on a dirty track. Our systems do not inherently expect any feedback response for anything. Our signals do not have lamp failure relays that drop them to a more restrictive aspect. Our occupancy detectors are not designed to have broken rail detection. The whole system is open loop, and only works correctly when all the pieces work. There is no expectation that items will report a failure when they misbehave.Basic electronics shows that "positive feedback with a delay drives a circuit into oscillation". (as in various types of oscillator circuits) I'm not sure how this is all that different.Dick :)On 07/09/2012 08:17 PM, Walter Thompson wrote:> All:> Been following along with this.

Thanks.And that's why "only retry your own" was on my priority list above "retry slowly".  I'm still not even sure how to do "retry slowly" vs "meter commands".  Given everything else that's going on, that's not as simple as it sounds.  Currently turnout commands are metered to the LocoNet, at least 1000*(18+3*10)*3/16000*2 msec between starting one command and starting the next.   We can certainly slow that down.  How to adjust that in the face of retransmissions really isn't clear.Bob--Bob Jacobsenrgj1927@... +1-510-486-7355 AIM, Skype JacobsenRG

I could tell this because I had been poking at my panel and noticed that it was always the last command or set of commands that gets repeated. The commands above (Stop 44) are to a stop relay that, as you can imagine, was chattering like a magpie until I turned on the track power. There was a noticeable delay after turning on track power before the repeating syndrome actually stopped. I take this to mean that it really is a timing issue, not a code bug in the Zephyr. In fact the repeating continued until the special initialization sequence started and the LocoNet started to see sensor messages.I.e. I think that any fix that watches the track power state will simply be a band aid on the real issue, which I still think is sending out Switch Request (turnout) commands faster than the DCC rate can accept them. The intervening sensor messages effectively slow the data rate for switch commands. Another proof for this is that the repeating syndrome can be stopped with throttle messages, even with the track power off. I suspect that the only difference related to track power is that the Zephyr is faster with its response when it isn't generating DCC commands.Can some one please simply try throttling down the Switch Request message rate? I think that would be the KISS solution.Dick :)

I just (partially) fixed a bug in trunk that was mentioned on the user's group for the 2.99.7 release (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/message/82703).Can that go into 2.99.8?Also discovered that using Application Menu->Quit on Mac OS X does not call windowClosing on all windows (it just slams them shut). If I can fix that by tomorrow, can it get into 2.99.8 (I'm thinking of having Apps3 add a shutdownAction that closes all the JmriJFrames individually)?Randall WoodAlexandria Software202.683.8604randall.h.wood@...http://www.alexandriasoftware.com

All,Ok, I stole some time from sleep/work to try to apply a fix for this.  I checked in some stuff as revision 20769, which failed JUnit testing of LnTurnoutManagerTest for one sub-test.  Due to lack of sleep and inability to continue working on this, I've backed out the changes (as revision 20771).My revision 20769 LnTurnoutManager code caused the test that attempts to "rename" a turnout to fail.I was unable to diagnose and resolve the root-cause of the problem. I suspect the problem is either in the mechanisms I used to attach a listener (for LnPowerManager events) to LnTurnoutManager, or in the mechanisms I attempted to hack into LnTurnoutManagerTest to instantiate a LnPowerManager and connect the LnTurnoutManager's listener to the test object's LnPowerManager instance.I've backed out the revision 20769 changes to LnTurnoutManger and the associated change in LocoNetSystemConnectionMemo.I left in the changes I had made to LnPowerManger, which provide more robust monitoring of track power status.  I had not seen any test fails due to those changes.If I see any problems from Jenkins or my local run of "alltests", and those issues that can be attributed to my changes, I'll do what I can to resolve them.Regards,B.

Dick (and list members),If the problem is lots of repeated traffic, but all of it eventually gets thru (without any intervention by other LocoNet activity), then I don't have any suggestions.When I first noticed this issue in mid-June, I started the thread 'Digitrax DCS51 and "infinite" switch command'.  A little bit later, I found that the problem of an "infinite" repeat was caused when DCs51 track power was off.  When track power was turned on, the problem disappeared.(I only found this problem, and this specific relationship, for a DCS51.  I did not have "infinite" repeats with my DCS100 or my DB150.)If you are getting an "infinite" repeat, then I would suspect that the DCS51 track power is off when these infinite repeats happen.  Another member on this list suggested that LocoNet activity from another source could cause the "infinite" repeat to stop.  Examination of the JMRI source code confirms this.I later suggested a possible change to the LnTurnoutManager's turnout message repeat feature.  The LnTurnoutManager could monitor track power state, and disable the repeat function whenever track power was off.  Perhaps that sort of change needs to happen sooner rather than later.  (I cannot commit to work on this for the forseeable future due to travel with unpredictable internet and hardware availability.)Regards,B.

Dick,Interesting.  I thought Bob was going to change JMRI so that it waited aftera LACK to see if someone else retries the Switch Req, and only if 30 msecelapses with no retry of the Switch Req by another device would JMRI send aretry.  Seems like that approach would also accomplish the throttling thatyou described below?Regards,Robin-----Original Message-----From: Dick Bronson [mailto:dick@...] Sent: Sunday, July 08, 2012 4:45 PMTo: Discussions between JMRI developersSubject: Re: [Jmri-developers] 2.99.8 test releaseOn 07/08/2012 06:37 PM, Bob Jacobsen wrote:> With david's help, I've started the 2.99.8 release build a bit earlierthan planned.

It seems to get triggered by the flood of initializationmessages and signal commands when a panel first starts up.It does not occur with a PR3.My theory is that JMRI is responding to the LONG_ACK by resending the missedcommand too quickly. The LocoBuffer has driver modifications that reduce itslatency due to USB buffering. From what I see above JMRI is re-sending thefailed switch request in 5-10ms.I presume that the LONG_ACK is sent by the Zephyr when its switch requestbuffer gets full trying to send them out to the DCC data stream. If the response to that message takes less time than it takes the Zephyr toempty its buffer, then it can never succeed until something else interruptsthe sequence. That is in fact just what happens. Sooner or later some otherLocoNet traffic intervenes and the repeating sequence stops.Would it be possible to prevent JMRI from sending out switch requestcommands to any individual interface port at a rate faster than the DCC datastream can accept them? Maybe limit it to 1/2 the DCC rate, or about 20msdelay per message?I think this same thing may explain why NCE systems can not be run reliablyat high baud rates. It wouldn't be the command station that has the problem.It would simply be that the data is coming too fast to all get processedinto the DCC data stream.My DCC Pocket Tester consistently shows a DCC packet rate of about 30Hz, butthe packet number update indicates something closer to 150Hz.

From what I see above JMRI is re-sending the failed switch request in 5-10ms.I presume that the LONG_ACK is sent by the Zephyr when its switch request buffer gets full trying to send them out to the DCC data stream. If the response to that message takes less time than it takes the Zephyr to empty its buffer, then it can never succeed until something else interrupts the sequence. That is in fact just what happens. Sooner or later some other LocoNet traffic intervenes and the repeating sequence stops.Would it be possible to prevent JMRI from sending out switch request commands to any individual interface port at a rate faster than the DCC data stream can accept them? Maybe limit it to 1/2 the DCC rate, or about 20ms delay per message?I think this same thing may explain why NCE systems can not be run reliably at high baud rates. It wouldn't be the command station that has the problem. It would simply be that the data is coming too fast to all get processed into the DCC data stream.My DCC Pocket Tester consistently shows a DCC packet rate of about 30Hz, but the packet number update indicates something closer to 150Hz. In any case 5-10ms is probably a bit fast for switch packets that need to be fit into the DCC data stream.Thanks for having a look at this. I'm sorry that I didn't say more sooner in the release cycle, but I just recently had a theory about the cause of the problem. I know a similar problem has shown up years ago when the Chief was set to meter the switch messages, but the Zephyr does not have the option to do that. (or disable it??)Dick :)

With david's help, I've started the 2.99.8 release build a bit earlier than planned. This is to provide a quick fix for the roster problems recently discussed on the jmriusers list.  Jenkins is building first files from SVN revision r20764 committed a little earlier today.We were planning to release this Tuesday with changes until then.  Let me know whether you think it should be advanced, or we should wait for that.Bob--Bob Jacobsenrgj1927@... +1-510-486-7355 AIM, Skype JacobsenRG

Alternately, you can override all of the functions in AbstractMRTrafficController that use istream or ostream.  This would require quite a bit of replicated code.Paul

(Days)  If so, we wait (up to a couple days) and rebuild when the fix is available. If not, we back out the changes and rebuild.I say mark it as a known issue and release.  The only thing that changed here is when things are read from the command station ( previously, it was at consist manager creation time, now it is when the consist tool loads ).  This was done so that we can update the list of consists displayed based on what is stored in the command station, but there is something happening with the loop in the NCE code that performs the update.  It is the same loop as was previously called, it is just called in a different place.I should be able to get to this before we release 2.99.7 next week.Paul

However if there is no need to change the mode, then mCurrentState stays is left in the incorrect state of either "WAITREPLYINPROGMODESTATE" or "WAITREPLYINNORMMODESTATE" and hence when the programming message is sent the states are different in the transmitWaits and hence it fails and the poll messages continue to be sent.Now by the looks of things this is quite an old bug introduced when the transmitWait method was added back in October 2010, but may have been introduced before then.The obvious solution appears to be to reset the mCurrentState back to WAITMSGREPLYSTATE either when the code has finished attempting to change the modes or if it determines that no message needs to be sent.At this late stage of the game, all I can confirm is that either solution fixes the issue that I have been seeing, but I don't know if this would cause any other unexpected issues for any other system.RegardsKevin

It would handle switching between them, if need be sending messages or whatever to put the command station into a different communications mode.  So if you asked to read/write a CV, it would go through the process of switching to Programming mode (perhaps sending a message), and handle that. If it didn't get another read/write request, it would switch back and then start handling the normal operations of sending messages, polling, etc.Sounds like it's maybe not handling the mode transitions properly, and hence getting confused about what it should be doing after the CV operation.Bob--Bob Jacobsenrgj1927@... +1-510-486-7355 AIM, Skype JacobsenRG

Can anyone explain to me the interaction between the poll queue, the normal queue with standard messages and programming messages?I have used the poll queue to get updates from the command station for power, turnouts and any locos currently under its control as the command station itself doesn't automatically provide updates.Now this all works and fits in with normal requests, so if I send a command to change a turnout or change the speed of a loco then the system waits for the return of the message prior to then servicing the poll queue.  However if I send out a request to read or write a cv, the system doesn't wait for the reply, but goes on to service the poll queue, which then causes a problem.So should the poll queue be serviced when we are programming or is there something else that I am missing out?RegardsKevin

A's constructor will run before B's constructor, and will involve B.foo() (which overrode A.foo()) before B has been fully constructed.  This can result in Bad And Mysterious Behaviour.The classic example of this is e.g. setPreferredSize(), which needs to now about the stuff in the subclass, but gets invoked when the window does it's layout.  (There are similar arguments for exception handling, particularly when connecting to outside code; and as a way of avoiding "getting a callback before you're fully ready to go" particularly when connecting to the hardware interfaces in JMRI)So the convention (which AFAIK comes from NetBeans) its that:1) The constructor creates all the objects2) initComponents uses those created objects to build the layout.More recently, initComponents can also create objects (e.g. JComponents for the display), particularly those that don't have saved references anywhere in the class.  That's often simpler than creating then in the constructor, because you can create them right near where you consume them.Bob--Bob Jacobsenrgj1927@... +1-510-486-7355 AIM, Skype JacobsenRG

Hi, I am new to the JMRI developers list and have started helping Dan Boudreau on some of the Operations parts. I am new to the Java and Swing world, but have extensive experience with Microsoft Windows Forms and WPF, so it is very easy for me to pick it up. I have been looking at the various approaches to constructing a form with it’s controls, and while I understand HOW it all works, I am looking for some guidance on what people have determined to be the “best practice” from real world experience. For example, there seem to be different schools of thought on whether or not the various panels, and controls should be added to the main frame in the frame’s constructor, or in a separate “initComponents” method that is called after the constructor. Both work, and both are used throughout JMRI, but I have to assume that there are reasons why one way may be better than the other. I’d like to get off on the right foot with my designs.Thanks a lotGreg Madsen

My long term goal (it's been aTechnically, the throttle is the system dependent code that sends messages from JMRI to a system connection.  It also handles feedback from the system if the system can provide that.  When system feedback causes a change in the throttle, a property change event is generated.  The throttlelistener interface is a way for the front end code to wait for the backend code to create a throttle.  It is in place because the throttle object may not be allocated instantaneously by the throttle code.> number of years so far) is to convert to Java code that becomes a pane on the normal throttle. The idea there is to simplify flipping back and forth between human and program running the loco. And the intent would be that things like functions could be done by the program or the human or if the human tried to do 'certain things' then the robot would disengage and let the human do 'whatever'. Pretty much like most automobiles and the cruise control. As long as we are talking about real throttles, and the system provides feedback though property change events, you can basically switch back and forth between hardware throttles and software throttles.  I know LocoNet and XPressNet can do this.  That is part of what makes the throttle bridge scripts work.Software throttles are a little more difficult because property change events are only sent if a property actually changes, and when a software throttle changes a property, that changes is not broadcast to all of the property change listeners ( because we can cause a race condition here if we are not careful ).Paul

I did look at the code for RT* and it does try to release the throttle. Now it does get a warning about not releasing a listener, but I don't see code where I acquired a listener for the throttle. And the code does send a zero as return code from the handle() so it does get removed from the thread list. BUT that does not happen if somewhere along the line it threw an error with a back trace. That seems to require doing a kill from the thread monitor to remove it.Anyway, I would like to understand a bit about the difference between a throttle and a throttle listener as I question if my code is always using the right one. My long term goal (it's been a number of years so far) is to convert to Java code that becomes a pane on the normal throttle. The idea there is to simplify flipping back and forth between human and program running the loco. And the intent would be that things like functions could be done by the program or the human or if the human tried to do 'certain things' then the robot would disengage and let the human do 'whatever'. Pretty much like most automobiles and the cruise control. A separate interface would rely on most of the same code where the human is 'in control' but the robot would override if needed. This would be a case of the loco is told to do the lesser of the human or robot requests. This dream is for an application that would let the museum visitors run the trains, but the system would override, flash, complain, etc.... if the user tried to run a signal for example.But at this time I've not been able to try this latest set of codes with a real system. I'm just not at the right layout with the time, computer, etc.... so I rely on Walt to test and confirm how it is working and trust his results.-ken cameronSyracuse Model Railroad Club http://www.SyracuseModelRr.org/ CNY Modelers   cnymod.comFinger Lakes Live Steamers http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org/ Member JMRI Developer Team http://www.jmri.org/ mailto: kcameron@...

After that point, the throttle will work as it normally does.I thought this was only affecting throttles started from the consisttool throttle button, but I confirmed tonight it is happening from thethrottle itself.This is however a LocoNet specific issue and, as Bob noted, I probablyintroduced it.Paul-- ______________________________________________________________________________	"Quality is a Characteristic of thought and statement that 	is recognized by a nonthinking process.

Bob,I need to fix the DCC address at 1 in the template for the Tam Valley DepotQuad decoder which I have promised to get done.  I'm away from the office soI can't test this at the moment, but certainly appreciate your getting toit.

Hi,We (RR-CirKits) welcome this effort. Especially if it will make uploading firmware to Digitrax products using our LocoBuffer-USB unit more reliable. One possible thing to watch for is that we use a modified Windows USB driver that changes the USB to serial default 16 ms latency to 1 ms in order to get a better response on small packets. These normally sit in a buffer until the latency period times out. I think an event driven protocol such as the LocoNet is more effected by this than something sending continuous data streams would be. Of course they have their own latency issues. <VBG>Dick :)On 06/29/2012 01:23 AM, B.

Has anyone looked into this:jmri.ConditionalVariable              ERROR - Type 9 not set for ClockThis happens for every Logix conditional that uses the clock range for a test. I can see from the code that only certain types get assigned a value and the rest get this error. But is it an error or should some of the entries do something instead of the error message?? This has to do with getting a NamedBean typically from the instance manager. But we've got something like 14 different types of conditionals types but a couple of them aren't here, like Script, Other, Audio, Last_Action, Last_State_Var for example.What I'm not sure is what it should do for these other types.-ken cameronSyracuse Model Railroad Club http://www.SyracuseModelRr.org/ CNY Modelers   cnymod.comFinger Lakes Live Steamers http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org/ Member JMRI Developer Team http://www.jmri.org/ mailto: kcameron@...

Could these directories exist under the existing JMRI directory in the usershome directory? Perhaps show a combo-box drop-down list of each directoryunder the JMRI directory.Alex

Coming back to this after a long time….I took "(or a Single JMRI	Application)" out of the subject line because I think that's completely irrelevant to the original idea.We actually do have something very similar to a "Railroad", defined as "everything about my particular setup, which I wish you'd keep in one convenient place".  That's a preference directory, which (should) contain the entire consistent set of stuff.As a Convenient Hack, people use the fact that different JMRI applications can be easily set to different preference directories as a stand in for what they really want, which is to have a way to select a "railroad" concept.   Or they use the various ways to create custom versions of the applications that start automatically with different preference directories (copy & rename the app on Mac, do something obscure on Windows to create a shortcut, etc)What's really wanted is a way to easily specify the preferences directory.  Setting aside where you put the preference for a permanent specification of the preferences directory, being able to hold down e.g. F5 or the Option key at startup time to pick a different one would be a nice feature.  Then we could start calling it a "railroad definition directory" or something like that, instead of just for preferences.BobOn Jun 17, 2012, at 9:26 PM, Alex Shepherd wrote:> Hi John,> >> I think there is value in being able to do the following>> >>     Start JMRI with the operations face using the offline test setup for> my club>> layout>>     Start JMRI so I can run real club operations connected to the club> layout>>     Start JMRI so I can run my home layout>>     Start JMRI so I can debug Walter's test panel>>     Start JMRI so I can program some decoders without messing up my club>> settings>>     etc.> > I really like this idea and have for a long time thought the current> wrappers DecoderPro and PanelPro were a rather weak concept. > > I'm someone who regularly uses the one JMRI system (on my laptop) in> different contexts and need to juggle different connection details and> systems so having explicit control like this would be really good.> > Perhaps leave the existing DecoderPro and PanelPro implementations as they> are but add a new Java Launcher that lets you select the "Railroad" from a> drop-down list of configurations and perhaps directories and go.> > Alex > > > ------------------------------------------------------------------------------> Live Security Virtual Conference> Exclusive live event will cover all the ways today's security and > threat landscape has changed and how IT managers can respond.

Hi,Is there some way to indicate that 3.0+ will not run, or at least have issues, on less than Java 1.6? Maybe a red text banner warning line on each of the main windows, sort of like when a port is not installed correctly, but maybe with a larger font. (sorry Bob, maybe red text isn't the best option) I'm thinking of something that will be in your face all the time letting you know that you have an issue to deal with if you expect full functionality.Dick :)On 06/26/2012 11:51 PM, david d zuhn wrote:>>> Also, is it time to put 2.14.1 out as a "last update without Java 1.6"?

The usual    way is to monitor 1 or 2 contacts as sensors. However AJ also has    included turnout feedback messages for this purpose. The idea is    that you can also set an option that will send these messages at the    interrogation time so the TC-64 can let the JMRI system know what    the state of everything was at the last power down. These messages    may also be sent whenever the turnout is thrown or closed using    switch messages, so theoretically JMRI could simply always monitor    the turnout feedback messages and not need any sensor feedback to    know the positions. Position feedback contacts can also be used send    this message type.<br>    <br>    I think this is what Steve is trying to get working. It is pretty    different than what most folks have done, so apparently the mileage    is varying. &lt;G&gt; Early TC-64 code had a bug in the turnout    feedback messages because we didn't understand the packet format    correctly. Most folks don't even realize that a third LocoNet    message type even exists, so it was quite a while before it got    noticed and fixed.<br>    <br>    Dick :)<br>    <br>    <br>    On 06/26/2012 06:44 PM, <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:ulvestad@...">ulvestad@...</a> wrote:    <blockquote      cite="mid:1618244.1459727.1340750704441.JavaMail.nitido@..."      type="cite"><span>Steve,</span><br>      <span>&nbsp;</span><br>      <span>Unfortunately I can't verify until next Tuesday but I        believe our TC-64s are set for port type of 'Detector' with        everything else at default.</span><br>      <span>&nbsp;</span><br>      <span>Peter</span><br>      <span>&nbsp;</span><br>      <span>On Jun 26, 2012, <strong>Stephen Brooks</strong>        <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:stevobrooks@...">&lt;stevobrooks@...&gt;</a> wrote:</span><br>      <div class="replyBody">        <blockquote class="email_quote" style="border-left: 2px solid          #267fdb; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 1.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">          <div dir="ltr">In the TC-64 I've selected the Switch Feedback            option using DP3 for the 3 turnouts I'm testing out.

When do we want to release JMRI 3.0?We can do a 2.99.7 pretty much whenever we want to, and use that as a last-test-before-3.0.  Or we can put out 2.99.7 with the intent to have another test release after it.Also, is it time to put 2.14.1 out as a "last update without Java 1.6"?

In the TC-64 I've selected the Switch Feedback option using DP3 for the 3 turnouts I'm testing out. They are setup in the secondary message section so I can set the exact address desired. The primary messages for these three turnouts are turned off. Per the firmware improvements, this all seems to work as intended, as the only messages I see coming back on the LocoNet Monitor appear to be Switch Feedback messages for the appropriate turnoutsWhen JMRI initially fires up it accurately sets the turnout state in response to the interrogation string and I can see the Switch Feedback messages for the 3 test turnouts mixed in with the General Sensor messages coming back from the other turnouts and occupancy sensors. I thought perhaps the TC-64 also sent out General Sensor messages for the 3 test turnouts, but the Sensor table shows the 3 applicable sensors as UnknownThe turnouts move in response to subsequent turnout commands, but JMRI seems to ignore the switch feedback messages generated in response and accordingly the switch feedback column doesn't register the changes in stateI see in the manual that the TC-64 can also generate Exact Switch Feedback messages and tried to configure a couple inputs this way for troubleshooting purposes, but couldn't figure out in DP3 how to set this upI've tried both the Indirect and Exact options in JMRI and see the same behavior. The Monitoring option works of course, since its looking at the commands going out, rather than the feedback coming backStevo> Date: Tue, 26 Jun 2012 14:11:57 -0400> From: dick@...> To: jmri-developers@...> Subject: Re: [Jmri-developers] LocoNet Turnout Feedback Message Glitch - Bug or am I Bone Headed?> > Steve,> Have you played any with the different turnout feedback types?> > Dick :)> > On 06/26/2012 12:25 PM, Ken Cameron wrote:> >> > Steve,> >> > I don’t know about that method.

In LocoNet, General Sensor and Switch Feedback are two distinct messages, each with its own address spaceIn JMRI, General Sensor messages are what appear in the Sensor Table and are also used for the One and Two Sensor options in the Turnout TableThe Switch Feedback messages aren't named in the tables, rather the status returned by them appears in the feedback state (hope I got that right) column of the Turnout Table when using the Indirect/Exact options. JMRI automatically pairs up the Switch Feedback messages with the matching turnout. In terms of the functionality provided, Indirect = One Sensor and Exact = Two SensorStevoFrom: kcameron@...To: jmri-developers@...Date: Tue, 26 Jun 2012 13:24:12 -0400Subject: Re: [Jmri-developers] LocoNet Turnout Feedback Message Glitch - Bug or am I Bone Headed?Steve, I know there are the two formats, but AFAIK JMRI doesn’t distinguish them.

To my understanding, the Monitor option follows the commands sent to the turnout. Watching the LocoNet monitor seems to confirm this, as one can see the turnout state change the moment to command appears on the monitorI'm using the feedback contacts and have traditionally used General Sensor message feedback via the Single Sensor option. When setup this way the turnout state doesn't change until the sensor message comes throughWith LocoNet one can use Genral Sensor messages for turnout feedback, but it also supports a completely separate address space referred to as Switch Feedback messages. Looking ahead as our layout expansion continues I can see the sensor table getting crowded, so I'd like to switch over to using the Switch Feedback messages. I'm currently deploying new hardware in advance of the convention and figured on making the switch as part of the installationI tried this a while ago and ran into various issues on the TC-64 side. Dick and I have worked through them and it appears the TC-64 now works as hoped and I'm all set to switch over. However it appears that I've run into a glitch on the JMRI side, in that JMRI currently seems to ignore the Switch Feedback messages when one tries to use the Indirect feedback option in the Turnout TableI know this used to work, as I verified this before I started working with Dick to work out the issues on the TC-64 sideStevoFrom: kcameron@...To: jmri-developers@...Date: Tue, 26 Jun 2012 12:25:51 -0400Subject: Re: [Jmri-developers] LocoNet Turnout Feedback Message Glitch - Bug or am I Bone Headed?Steve, I don’t know about that method.

I went trapping and it seems that in the conditional, in setName(), it only manages for a subset of the conditional types. Now with a variable name like 'Clock' I tracked it back at it seems to happen because I've got a conditional that looks at the fast clock and triggers when the clock is between X and Y. At least that's my guess right now.But it lists the error 8 times but I only have two Logix that look at the fast clock and each one only does it once!?-ken cameronSyracuse Model Railroad Club http://www.SyracuseModelRr.org/ CNY Modelers   cnymod.comFinger Lakes Live Steamers http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org/ Member JMRI Developer Team http://www.jmri.org/ mailto: kcameron@...

> One thing I'd love is when we are loading and it finds a connection missing, it gives the option to bail out of the whole startup. Handy for when you forgot to plug something in or turn it on first. So instead of gets a zillion error messages to click through (and have to exit and restart anyway) you could just exit and go make your fixes.Or better yet, deal with insertion of devices on the fly, so theprogram can warn you that "device X is not attached", and then as soonas you attach the device it begins working.   In the meantime,everything that isn't device X should still work.Correspondingly, as different devices are recognized, the program candefault to different courses of action.  For example, when I am athome, I have a LocoBuffer with a specific ID.  At a friend's, there isa different LocoBuffer ID.  At another's, a USB serial adapter of agiven type.  Starting up JMRI at any one of these places could bringup a different config, a different default roster, etc.-- david d zuhn  Saint Paul Bridge & Terminal Ry.zoo @ stpaulterminal.org

So instead of gets a zillion error messages to click through (and have to exit and restart anyway) you could just exit and go make your fixes.As for the 'coupling' of the panel, one example would be two configuration files, one with real connections and one with simulators. You call the same panel files. Maybe with a few different scripts loaded to support the simulation. I do this all the time using multiple startups. Which is better: some menu option or just a screen full of startups?? I don't know and don't think it's worth the effort to change. What might be better is some sort of help to make it easier for people to setup the number of startups needed for what they want to do. For those who understand them, doing a copy and edit of the properties is easy.

There are still a few that have not been converted though.I plan to modify the JMRI client code so that it can replace the connection prefix used on the client side with the prefix used on the remote end.  This will create an alias system for objects.This could also be useful in the SRCP code, where the connections are numbered instead of lettered.Paul

As yousay, loading a [layoutConnection] panel without an actual[layoutConnection] layout connection isn[t going to do what you expect,primarily because the objects used by the panel won't be instantiated inthe first place.  Then there is the whole ungainlyrestart-to-load-a-new-config mess...I keep thinking that the layout connection names ("N", "L"...) in thepanels should really be virtual things, with a mapping to the physicalthings being driven by a combination of the config file currently in useand some other (as yet undefined) mechanism.I'd like to hear from Randall before I put too many more words in his mouth:-)  -John

I'm someone who regularly uses the one JMRI system (on my laptop) indifferent contexts and need to juggle different connection details andsystems so having explicit control like this would be really good.Perhaps leave the existing DecoderPro and PanelPro implementations as theyare but add a new Java Launcher that lets you select the "Railroad" from adrop-down list of configurations and perhaps directories and go.Alex

In developing the Jetty replacement for the Mini Web Server, Idiscovered that not only can the ZeroConf network name be anything,but that its trivial for us to set it.So I incorporated a "Railroad Name" property in the web serverpreferences, and it all works great, but the Operations module alsohas a concept of the Railroad Name (and can handle multiple railroadnames), so there's at least two pieces in JMRI that have concepts of aname for a railroad.And this lead to me thinking, why not have JMRI be "railroad-centric"in design. Why shouldn't all aspects of JMRI be centered around theidea that JMRI controls a model railroad layout?So, here's the idea: Make the railroad be the core configuration itemwithin JMRI. ALL other configuration would be subject to the railroad,and all application-specific configuration would becomerailroad-specific. This would require significant changes to JMRI. Asfar as user-visible changes:1) JMRI applications would prompt for the railroad to use if the shiftkey or space bar is held down during start, and otherwise start withthe last used railroad (kind of like the "press F8 to disable Logix"prompt) unless some parameter like --railroad=railroad_name is passedto force the application to start with a specific railroad.2) All preferences would be in /path/to/JMRI/prefs/[railroad_name]instead of in /path/to/JMRI/prefs/ (with the exception of a file thatcontains what we need to know to display the railroad prompt) to allowa user to switch between preferences profilesThis could also make it possible (assuming we can get a usable userinterface for this) to ship only a single JMRI application instead ofthe 6 or 7 we currently ship...-- Randall WoodAlexandria Softwarehttp://www.alexandriasoftware.comrandall.h.wood@...202.683.8604

B, do you know if your test unit is the original or update??Rev 0.2 firmware is available on the Digitrax web site.  The unit I am using has 0.3 firmware.  The DCS51 firmware revision can be determined by turning off track power and reading the revision number on the display.>What is needed to test this setup??You can duplicate my results with a DCS51, your LocoNet interface of choice, and a properly configured JMRI install.There is no need for a physical switch or any sort of stationary decoder which is sensitive to switch commands on LocoNet or on the track bus.  Don't even need a throttle.To duplicate my findings: Turn track power on.  Start JMRI.  Open the LocoNet monitor.  Open the Turnout Tool.  Send a few turnout commands to the (LocoNet) switch number of your choice.  Note that no LONG_ACK (fail) messages appear in the LocoNet Monitor.Then turn track power off (via DCS51 control or via JMRI Power Control Tool).  Then send a few more turnout commands.  Now you'll see LONG_ACK(fail) messages in the LocoNet Monitor.The above assumes that the Bushby OpSw (OpSw 27) is in the factor-default, Thrown, state to disable the Bushby function.If the DCS51 Bushby OpSw is closed, then LONG_ACK(Fail) is not generated, regardless of track power status, and switch commands do not go to the track bus unless some other LocoNet agent works some magic.  I have not experimented to see if this configuration would cause LONG_ACK(fail) when track power is off.Regards,B.

I know there has been at least one update to the DCS51 since it first came out. B, do you know if your test unit is the original or update??What is needed to test this setup?? I've got a DCS51 at home, which I know I updated at least once. I might be able to test with this. Do you need to have some sort of switch controller out there to get the behavior or just tell it there is one?? I've got a DS64 somewhere and a Sic24AC if I can find them.-ken cameronSyracuse Model Railroad Club http://www.SyracuseModelRr.org/ CNY Modelers   cnymod.comFinger Lakes Live Steamers http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org/ Member JMRI Developer Team http://www.jmri.org/ mailto: kcameron@...

Bob,Results of further testing revealed:. This behavior was seen on a factory-new, direct from the box DCS51 with no OpSw setting changes, WHEN TRACK POWER IS OFF.. When the same factory default command station OpSw values are used, and Track Power is ON, the OPC_LACK(Fail) messages do not happen.. Reset to factory default (OpSw 39) and then a power cycle did not change the operation noted in the above two points.Regards,B.

Hi,please allow me to add my two cents here.Yes I did notice this behavior with my DCS51 as well. DCS100, DCS50 and all other command stations are NOT affected AFAIK.I can only second whatever has been described in this thread.Furthermore a few additional remarks:- The behavior came "straight out of the box" hence with standard OpSwitch settings.- I tested with an "old" LocoBuffer II with USB adapter and a current LocoBufferUSB with similar response on Mac OS X.- Having an address selected with the DCS51 and rapidly changing speed on the built in throttle did make this effect go away. This is probably with the preference of the command station to preempt the LocoBuffer and then the latter to "drop" the conflicting messages sometimes later.As I di just move last wekend into a new flat all my railroad equipment is still safely stored in boxes. As soon as my office is back in operational state I might redo tests if needed.SimonOn Jun 15, 2012, at 2:15 AM, jmri-developers-request@... wrote:> Send Jmri-developers mailing list submissions to> 	jmri-developers@...> > To subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit> 	https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jmri-developers> or, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to> 	jmri-developers-request@...> > You can reach the person managing the list at> 	jmri-developers-owner@...> > When replying, please edit your Subject line so it is more specific> than "Re: Contents of Jmri-developers digest..."> > > Today's Topics:> >   1.

<off-list reply>Walt,What you are seeing for your DCS50 is what I see for my DCS100.It makes some sense to me that a OPC_LACK(Fail) could/should be sent in the case where track power is off.  The command station cannot forward the switch command to the track if track power is off.  Perhaps someone has decided that the "sensible" thing is what the command station ought to do.Regards,B.

Robin - you are correct that JMRI will retry any switch command, regardless of its source.I have also found out that the DCS51 will always reply with a failing OPC_LACK (failing) if DCS51 track power if off.  That is the source of the "infinite" retries.If I instead start JMRI when track power is on, there is no infinite repeat.  If I start JMRI with DCS51 track power off, the infinite repeat begins, but if I then turn on track power, the problem disappears.Seems to me that it might make some sense in LnTurnoutManager to perhaps check the track status before retrying.  If track power is off, don't retry.  Or the code could instead retry once, and if another fail results, check track status, and only continue retrying if track is powered.  Or perhaps check track status every 10th retry.  Or some such.Regards,B. MilhauptAt 10:01 AM 6/13/2012, you wrote:>Hi.

I'm trying to determine whether I've found a bug in the DCS51 or "just" a cross-incompatibility between DCS51 functionality and a JMRI feature.Is anyone having success using JMRI with a DCS51 as a command station?  Can anyone with a DCS51 duplicate or refute the findings I describe below?When doing some testing with a recent DCS51 used as a command station, I find that JMRI swamps LocoNet with switch command "repeats" at any occurrance of a switch command on LocoNet.  It doesn't matter if that switch command comes from a throttle or from a JMRI process.When this happens, any device with an LED showing LocoNet activity indicates pretty much constant LocoNet usage.I find that the DCS51 ALWAYS replies to OPC_SW_REQ messages with a failing OPC_LACK.This "failing OPC_LACK" triggers the JMRI fast "retry" mechanism in loconet.LnTurnoutManager .  The result is a huge amount of traffic on LocoNet, of the form:[B0 01 00 4E]  Requesting Switch at LT2 () to Thrown (output Off).[B4 30 00 7B]  LONG_ACK: Switch request Failed![B0 01 00 4E]  Requesting Switch at LT2 () to Thrown (output Off).[B4 30 00 7B]  LONG_ACK: Switch request Failed![B0 01 00 4E]  Requesting Switch at LT2 () to Thrown (output Off).[B4 30 00 7B]  LONG_ACK: Switch request Failed!This traffic continues until some other message type slips in immediately after the retried OPC_SW_REQ message.  This causes the LnTurnoutManager retry mechanism to stop its retries.[B0 01 00 4E]  Requesting Switch at LT2 () to Thrown (output Off).[B4 30 00 7B]  LONG_ACK: Switch request Failed![B0 01 00 4E]  Requesting Switch at LT2 () to Thrown (output Off).[A0 02 00 5D]  Set speed of loco in slot 2 to 0.Unfortunately, JMRI sends the special "interrogate" switch commands at start-up.  So immediately on JMRI start-up, JMRI gets into a loop re-sending the OPC_SW_REQ that was just seen on LocoNet - the interrogate command.I do not see this problem with my early-release DCS100, or with an early DB150 running as a command station.Note that It >appears< that the DCS51 may have firmware that is more recent than the firmware currently available on the Digitrax web site.  I believe that the DCS51 I am using has revision 0.3 firmware, while the Digitrax website download page shows revision 0.2 firmware.  So perhaps the problem I am seeing is a "feature" of newer DCS51 firmware.  Or perhaps it is an issue that has always been there, but has not yet been reported, or the report was not noticed by JMRI developers.If nothing else, the LnTurnoutManager "retry" mechanism probably needs some re-work for use with any DCS51 which exhibits this problem.  But perhaps this is an unintended problem with a specific DCS51 firmware revision.  Input from other JMRI developers can help figure out which of these cases need to be addressed.Thanks,B. Milhaupt

We may want to evolve to a completely browser based solution, which is possible with Java 1.6 or later.  Until we do that, though, all the help files (all the files accessed by the program via the help mechanism) have to be in a file tree under the directory with the JavaHelp control files.

Kevin,Keep in mind the issue is the size of the download. So it might mean building two 'installs' where one is just to 'install' the manual. Or one with and one without the manuals.My own thought is the normal 'install' regardless of platform is just the program and normal help. The manuals are separate, either as an install or just PDF's depending. The other option would be the installs come in flavors of 'online' or 'offline', same was the Java, where the 'online' expects the web to always be available. So even the help wouldn't be part of the download if it is able to just point to the web instead.When I joined the project, the number of 'online' vs 'offline' favored the offline a lot. This time around I'm feeling I see well over 50% are online users. Right now I only know of two clubs that are offline and maybe 1 home layout out of 10 or more.So just more options to consider. Given the talk of the repository for resources maybe this is more significant to think about the whole on/off line issue.-ken cameronSyracuse Model Railroad Club http://www.SyracuseModelRr.org/ CNY Modelers   cnymod.comFinger Lakes Live Steamers http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org/ Member JMRI Developer Team http://www.jmri.org/ mailto: kcameron@...

The next most convenient thing is a"download manual" button/menu/command in the program which grabs therelevant portions of the manual and installs them to the correctplace.Barring these, I think keeping the manual out of the help pages mightbe best, given their separate update schedules anyway.  If we do that,it's a simple zip file that unpack to its own top-level directory.For those who want "off-line" access to the manual (e.g, reading itbefore they start on the programming process, perhaps away from theirprogramming computer), making it part of the help structure may not beas useful.   Especially for the PDF download -- that's a completelydifferent use case than the html version.   That probably alwaysshould be a separate top-level component.-- david d zuhn  Saint Paul Bridge & Terminal Ry.zoo @ stpaulterminal.org

But trying to get a good error message to make sense of it wasn't so easy.>> I think they had built the panel and then went back and added the blocks and sensors but missed editing a few track segments to have the correct block.>> Kevin, I think you've done the bulk of this editor so I'm asking you to see what should be improved in the error handling. Let me know what else might help you figure this one.>> -ken cameron, CCP.Hi Ken,This is potentially an issue, where the user has gone back andre-edited the tracks to add real blocks in.  One thing I did add tothe menu structure on the layout editor is the ability toautomatically assign blocks to tracks and turnouts when they arecreated, this in theory will help to prevent having bits of track withno block assigned.On thing that I could do is perform a check as part of the switchingon of the layout block routing that there are no bits of track withouta block assigned, and somehow highlight the bits of track to the user.How we could go about identifing discontinuous bits of track isanother question, maybe some sort of validation when you assign ablock to a bit of track would be a good start but i'm not overly sureabout the best way to do this.  A bit of code that validates theconnectivity would be another good one, but again i'm not sure whereto start that one from either.  Could you let me know what bits ofdebug you added into place to help pin-point the problem.RegardsKevin

E.g. maybe it shouldn't be buried inside the help directory, but rather right at the top level in a "manual" directory of it's own.  Might also want to think about how to handle multiple manual versions (2.14 etc) in that case.Bob--Bob Jacobsenrgj1927@... +1-510-486-7355 AIM, Skype JacobsenRG

This sounds like a great concept to me daveI tried WinRAR in a Word file and see what you mean. It opened it up no problem. Interesting to see how many different parts make up even a simple documentThis would certainly help users like our club who have custom signal definitions, signal icons, and panel icons banging around in the program folders. More times than I'd like to admit, I've sat down to work on our panel at home, only to realize I forgot to copy the latest version of the various custom files onto my flash drive. In fact, just a couple weeks ago I reorganized my JMRI flash drive to make it clearer exactly which files I need to copy and where they are locatedIf I understand correctly, this concept would also simplify matters on the Windows installer front, as Matt could treat each install as a fresh install without worrying about deleting someone's custom stuff in the processBTW - You coming to the national in Grand Rapids?Stevo> Date: Sun, 10 Jun 2012 11:34:41 -0500> From: zoo@...> To: wsthompson@...; jmri-developers@...> Subject: Re: [Jmri-developers] Web Based Icon Depository> > > I read this as having the resources for the panel in the panel.xml or maybe a panels folder.> > Neither.

I've got a users panel that throws up on this part when the addPath has a null as the block. So for my debugging I just added a test for it and error message so I get that logged (with the origin block) so I knew where to start looking. But I don't know which other parts of this call should get skipped when this happens.The panel error seems related to where they used a block name for two turnouts (it looks like part of what would be an interlock) but had a short track segment that was coded as a different block. So the whole connection stuff was messed up. But trying to get a good error message to make sense of it wasn't so easy.I think they had built the panel and then went back and added the blocks and sensors but missed editing a few track segments to have the correct block.Kevin, I think you've done the bulk of this editor so I'm asking you to see what should be improved in the error handling.

> So if you download the 'production' you get the production manual, but if you download a test release, do you get just the 'test' manual or that plus the last production copy??Myself, I think a test release should mimic a production release asmuch as possible, so we shouldn't make any decision about what toinclude on the basis of test v. production.Right now there's no distinction -- you get whatever is inhelp/en/manual in the source tree, packed into the distribution file.The problem, as I see it, is that the branching strategy for themanual is to create separate directories with the version number inthem, all in the same trunk of the tree.

Ken,At the moment, you get all the manuals that have been written so faras pdf's, along with the current html version.This is true for both production and test releases.As you suggest, it might be worthwhile spinning some of these off intoadditional packages - this is now much simpler to do thanks to david'ssterling effort with the CI engine now doing the builds for us.I was thinking that we could offer both 'full-fat' and 'lite' versionsof the download, with the 'lite' being without any documentation andpulling from the web when needed.Thoughts?Best regards,Matt HOn 11 June 2012 17:35, Ken Cameron <kcameron@...> wrote:> David,>> So if you download the 'production' you get the production manual, but if you download a test release, do you get just the 'test' manual or that plus the last production copy??>> The other idea, and I don't recall how the debate went last time, is making the 'manuals' a separate download.

The distribution files for JMRI 2.99.x are getting very large.  One ofthe reasons for this is the way we include the manuals(help/en/manual).This is 48MB of the 156MB downloaded & expanded package.There is a JMRI 2.12 manual, two JMRI 2.14 manual, and two 2.99manuals (in progress, nearly empty).The branching scheme for the rest of JMRI is such that versionspecific information goes into version specific branches and the headstays current.  That is not how the manual is working, and the systemwe have used to do (copy all of the help files into the release) nolonger works.I propose that we move these manuals to a new location in the tree(outside of help/ altogether), and in that portion of the tree themanuals would continue to be produced however Dale would like toproceed.   Somewhere in the build process we would then take thelatest version of the manuals (and ONLY the latest version) that isrelevant, and copy them into the distribution in the current location.-- david d zuhn  Saint Paul Bridge & Terminal Ry.zoo @ stpaulterminal.org

> I read this as having the resources for the panel in the panel.xml or maybe a panels folder.Neither.  The suggestion is for keeping them in the ZIP file, andusing them from there (instead of unpacking the zip file and usingindividual files).For example, a modern MS Word document is a zip file that contains(possibly) many different resources, any or all of which can be usedby that document.  But instead of having to have the user collect allof the resources when they want to copy the file, it's all done byWord and kept in that zip file (which isn't named xyz.zip so thereisn't really a temptation on the part of a normal user to go peekinginto the internals).Similarly, a jar file contains many different resources, and war fileseven more so, all of which can potentially be used without unpackingthe file.Especially if JMRI separates the notion of "standard images" and "userinstalled images", the image references in the panel zip file could bebroken into two.  One is a logical reference to a file contained inthe standard distribution (say, via a URL likeimage:standard:left-arrow.gif).  References to user images might looklike (image:user:foobar.gif).   Finding the foobar.gif file nowbecomes a simple exercise of looking through the image folder in thepanel's zip file, and then to the user's preferences folder.Exporting a panel would be an extra step, which would take any imagesfound in user's preference folder and then copy them to the zip file. The "save everything" option would ALSO include all of the imagesfrom the JMRI distribution, and then munge the reference URL to callit a user image now.

I think we should, to the extent possible, adopt the Apple philosophy that the application should just manage all it's own data. In our case it means that JMRI should not let users put files where users want them to be, but should automatically place referenced files (images and icons for rosters and panels mostly) in the appropriate place within the Preferences folder.This would also imply that we should support allowing users to symlink the preferences directory to a location in a Dropbox, Google Drive, or similar folder so they can use those mechanisms to synchronize data between multiple computers.Sent from my iPhoneOn Jun 10, 2012, at 8:25, Walter Thompson <wsthompson@...> wrote:> So a user would end up with all the icons and images that they want to use in there Preferences>resources?> > This seems to go along with what I have be attempting, having everything to build a panel on a thumb drive.> > I think the first step would be to convert all icons currently on a panel to be in the Preferences>resources folder.

So a user would end up with all the icons and images that they want to use in there Preferences>resources?This seems to go along with what I have be attempting, having everything to build a panel on a thumb drive.I think the first step would be to convert all icons currently on a panel to be in the Preferences>resources folder. That would remove the problem of users currently putting custom icons in the Program>JMRI>resources folder. When issues happen with panel files we could have them upload the Panel,xml and the roster folder.The side issue with my attempt to have the resources on the thumb drive is with the address of the file. JMRI seems to want an image type file there and won't use an address to the image.

I'm using no more than about 50Mb, so i'd be quite happy to have it hosted there, with it hidden behind the JMRI front end.RegardsKevin

E.g. where should various tests releases and accumulation(s) of fixes go?And should 2.14.1 be released sometime?

The first is for systems where there's no overlaps, but had to give way to the 2nd so that the calling code could handle the overlaps.

Within JMRI, an address can be long or short. Only when applied to a given vendor system might there be an overlap of space or an invalid result. Which is why we have selectors that give both the box for an address value and the long/short selection.I think we do default the long/short based on long for 128 and greater and short for 127 and less. But I recall code that takes the number, decides if there could be an overlap, then requires the selection of long or short. If the number isn't in the overlap range, then it sets the correct mode.Now this means if a system has connections to multiple systems, the throttle has to know which system it is connected to so it knows those values.-ken cameronSyracuse Model Railroad Club http://www.SyracuseModelRr.org/ CNY Modelers   cnymod.comFinger Lakes Live Steamers http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org/ Member JMRI Developer Team http://www.jmri.org/ mailto: kcameron@...

Is it possible for short and long address spaces to overlap in JMRI?For instance in some hardware cabs "4" would be a short address but "04" would be a long address.All I am aware of is the isLongAddress(int num) method in the system specific throttle manager that tests against a system specific value to determine the difference. Any notion of a leading zero is lost by that time.Andrew

I believe that's due to the way Windows enumerates USB devices. There is an FTDI app note that talks about it. The FTDI based SPROGs all have the same serial number programmed into them, so thay always reuse the same COM port even if the physical connection changes.Regards,Andrew

I was also worried that peoplemight be becoming more frustrated with trying lots of different thingsout without, seemingly, progress being made.As far as the issue being chipset sensitive, this means that for FTDIand SiLabs, those companies have written their own device driver foruse under Windows for simulating a serial port.Microchip, with their USB-enabled PIC chips are, rather than writingtheir own, use the Microsoft supplied usbser.sys driver to simulate aserial port.Digitrax use such a Microchip PIC in the PR3.I do have some changes to the native code in RXTX to try out but Ineed to get access to my wife's Win7 x64 machine to actuallyre-compile and test.(Thanks to Kevin, I do have a PR3 to test with).I've tried running 64-bit Windows within a virtual machine on my32-bit Vista box but this doesn't exhibit the symptoms - this will bedue to certain aspects of the virtualisation deferring to theunderlying 32-bit sub-system.Will keep everyone posted.Best regards,Matt H

With the Roster Media, you can set a roster image and a roster icon. The problem I have found is that if you drag over a bmp file into the icon, it displays on the screen correctly, however in the combo boxes or the roster table the icon is not displayed.Does anyone have any ideas? it works fine it I use a png format instead.RegardsKevin

Unpack the zip file.  Run from the directory.Doesn't touch the registry.  Doesn't need an installer.  Doesn't needan uninstaller.  I can have multiple versions installedsimultaneously.  I can create shortcuts as I want them easily enough.I wonder if there's enough similar sentiment to warrant a Windows"package" like this that works without an installer.   I'd use it, andsuggest it to my local Windows using friends.  If for nothing else,they could download and try a new version without messing anything up(unless we do backwards incompatible changes to the user files).Perhaps releasing this in parallel with the Installer based package --user chooses which they want?  But then we'd have to explain thedifferences in a way that people would understand, and allowconversion to/from.I don't use JMRI Windows often enough to warrant my spending the timeto do this myself.-- david d zuhn  Saint Paul Bridge & Terminal Ry.zoo @ stpaulterminal.org

The user just puts it where it's wanted, and off they go.  There's no "install" process needed. The older version's directory can stay around, or not, the new version doesn't have anything to do with the old one.On Windows, the process has always been different because it's involved an installer and a well-defined install location (either a default that the installer locates, or one picked by the user).  This seems to have something to do with the "Start menu short cuts" and "desktop thingies" that Windows users expect.  The Window installer could "remove everything from the install location and start with a fresh directory" (perhaps setting the contents aside in a backup directory), but I don't know whether that would actually be a good thing or a bad thing from the viewpoint of Windows users.

> The launchers could be extended to look for .jar files in the preferences directory (or better, a lib/ directory in the preferences directory) but that would bring back the same problem of somebody having an older file that causes conflicts.But someone who adds a jar file to a user-specified directory of codeis a different use case than "updating the standard installation tothe latest release".We can't prevent all problems.  We can reduce the likelihood.  I thinkit's safer to say, with each release, "this is the list of librariesthat make up the standard release, we should use these and no others". Adding a separate place where users can add a library is making clearthe distinction between the released package and what the user isadding.In a previous life, I worked on a package that did something like this:Each time the program ran, it added the jar files in${userdir}/lib/${version} and ${userdir}/lib to the classpath.Someone who wanted to be very careful about version compatibilitycould add jar files to the version specific directory, and the nextrelease wouldn't see them since it would have a different version.Someone who didn't care about this level of compatibility could justadd to the lib/ directory and proceed.This worked fairly well for our users.-- david d zuhn  Saint Paul Bridge & Terminal Ry.zoo @ stpaulterminal.org

Then we truly control what is in the program file.Bug report #3529907, submitted last night is about this.The start of every release note could have bold warnings about upgrading from previous releases for things like the Tsunami update and for this what ever would need to be done to move these files to the new correct location.I am aware that users do not read the release notes. Thats apparent with the users problems with Tsunami's failing after an update, but enough of us on the users list know the solution.WaltWalt Thompson1405 Portland AveSaint Paul, MN55104Ph 651-644-8673Moderator, Yahoo JMRIusers groupTLR, TCDNMRA #136859

Commenting just on Bob's point below, the only internet rfc that handles remote serial control is rfc 2217.  There are servers that handle this protocol for Linux and MacOS.  I am not sure about Windows.  There even appears to be a java implementation of an rfc2217 server, so that may be a good transition for our users ( assumming it works, and i have not tried it yet )There are at least two open source java libraries that implement the javax.comm.serialport api using the rfc 2217 protocol.PaulSent from my HTC on the Now Network from Sprint!----- Reply message -----From: "Bob Jacobsen" <rgj1927@...>Date: Fri, May 18, 2012 11:34 pmSubject: [Jmri-developers] Serial Port ConnectivityTo: "Discussions between JMRI developers" <jmri-developers@...> The general capability is sometimes called an "access server".

This would just be a server that runs in the background> and connects a network socket connection to a serial port.(leaving a lot attached below to preserve the level of detail for later discussion)I think having a very simple serial-server is, in the long term, the right way forward.  (I have no opinion about RXTX or variants on the short term)Stressing _simple_, that could be done with native code on each platform relatively easily.  No need to worry about cross platform issues, or breaking existing support when adding a new architecture, etc.For example, a nice little Mac OS X application would probably be structured completely differently from a Windows one in terms of serial port access, port selection, preferences storage, etc.  But since they only do _one_ thing, there's not a lot of common code to share in any case.The general capability is sometimes called an "access server".  If we use a common protocol (instead of making up our own), perhaps we wouldn't even have to write the server code, and people could use e.g. hardware devices for this.  IIRC, there are a couple protocols where the control leads need to be monitored or controlled.  (Beyond the ones where they're the flow control, which I assume the server would do locally).

Arduino captures a far more general audience thanwe do, and they still use RxTx.Personally, if we don't follow the same locking mechanisim Arduino uses,then I will have problems with my own work, since I frequently amswitching back and forth between the two environments.Paul-- ______________________________________________________________________________	"Quality is a Characteristic of thought and statement that 	is recognized by a nonthinking process.

I'm just now returning to this problem.  While I have some good information from Walt that confirms my test results for a DCS100, I find that I do not have sufficient data to progress with the DB150, DCS50 and DCS51.So I'm looking for volunteers who can do some experiments and report results to me.The experiment is a simple process that takes less than 10 minutes to gather the information from a command station.  Volunteers need access to DB150, DCS50 and/or DCS51 command stations as well as a DT300-series or a DT40x-series throttle.  A live JMRI connection to the command station helps speed up the experiment but is not required.Please let me know if you can help.Regards,B.

Randall,No objection here, but changing the dialog box type sounded like somethingI might could figure out, what you describe is above my pay grade.  :)I agree changing all of them would be a waste of time, but these particularTrain and Conductor windows have received quite a bit of attention latelyfor use via the frameserver.To be clear, the stall is not occurring on a click, but on the attempt toretrieve the next frame image from any open frame.Regards,  SteveTOn Fri, May 18, 2012 at 9:50 PM, Randall Wood <randall.h.wood@...> wrote:> I don't want us to fix a large number of specific control points (error> dialogs) to fix this issue, since that's going to be an endless task with> little reward.

That's where any other lock file that the systemwill produce will be located (try this:  lockdev -l /dev/ttyUSB0 [orwhatever device you happen to have handy - it does have to exist]; thelock file will be located in /var/lock/lockdev).   That's also thedirectory that is group writeable (by group 'lock' still).  So thenotional location of "lock directory" has indeed changed, as this usedto be /var/lock that met these criteria.   That's one of the lockdirectories found in the rxtx source code - which searches a list ofcommon lock directories to find the one that's writable./var/lock/lockdev is not in that list.  It'll be trivial to add, butthen we need to rebuild - it's not configurable via a propertysetting.-- david d zuhn  Saint Paul Bridge & Terminal Ry.zoo @ stpaulterminal.org

Dan and Randall,I checked 2.14, and you can lock up JMRI the same way (open a modal dialogbox, then try and retrieve a frameserver image), so this is not new withJetty.  I also checked 2.12, but the same action did not result in an errorbox at all at 2.12.  The Move button was just ignored.Modal dialog boxes on the server are never going to play well with aframe-scraping web interface.  Is it required for that error to be handledas a modal dialog box?  Showing the error as part of the Trains windowshould work.SteveTOn Thu, May 17, 2012 at 4:03 PM, Dan Boudreau <daboudreau@...>wrote:> **> I've been playing with the JMRI Web Server and have run into an issue.> When a popup message is activated via a browser, it locks up JMRI when the> web server is running.

>> Does or will ways exist to control which interfaces it will bind to??>Jetty is pretty powerful, so I'm sure there's a way to manage this.  Idoubt seriously that there is any code in JMRI to manage the for userinterface for this.  It will be a right royal PITRE to make a good UI forit, and it's got pretty limited use cases to limit binding to specificaddresses.Yes, I know the club machine with internal and external addresses withdifferent requirements for each access location matches that use case.   Istill think you're best off doing that with user based authentication.-- david d zuhn  Saint Paul Bridge & Terminal Ry.zoo @ stpaulterminal.org

You're not an unusual case at all -- almost every computer sold these days has at least 2 nics (one ether and one wireless).The closing info messages are not our doing - that's the jetty server, and those messages are benign at a benign time. I don't know if we can silence those without losing other possibly useful information.I think it's likely a threading issue that causes the frame server to freeze. Did this happen in earlier versions with dialog boxes as well? I won't be able to look into this until maybe July if someone else wants to.Sent from my iPhoneOn May 17, 2012, at 16:34, david d zuhn <zoo@...> wrote:> 240665 server.AbstractConnector INFO - Started SelectChannelConnector@...:12080 [Thread-11]  <- would be nice if the actual IP address of the web server was shown here.> > What about machines with multiple IP addresses?   if you pick just one, it'll probably be wrong.

I've been playing with the JMRI Web Server and have run into an issue.  Whena popup message is activated via a browser, it locks up JMRI when the webserver is running.  If someone want to try and fix, simply open the trainswindow and press the move button using the browser for any train that isn'tbuilt. I also have a comment about using the INFO to show what I think is debuginformation.  I can't see how a user would gain anything by reading thefollowing information when shutting down the Web Server.

>> Hate to be a pest but what does it mean when Netbeans src folder has a> little blue dot and says it "Contains new, modified or deleted files or> properties."Well, that means the that the contents of the folder (recursively) containsat least one of the following:   a new file unknown to version control   a file under version control that has been modified   a file that has been deleted(just what the message says ;)   )Since Subversion also records file properties (type, permissions, etc),those file properties are what is possibly changed, not necessarily thefile contents.And how do I correct it? In that folder the jmri.jmrit,operations has the> blue dot. Also the jmri.jmrit.operations.trains has a Red dot and says it> has a "conflict"It's not necessarily something that needs correction.  It depends on whatthe changes are.   If you don't ever expect to check them in, then yourcorrections more or less come down to "remove the local changes; update toget the correct bits from the SVN server".Conflicts are where you have made a change locally, and someone else hasmade a change in the same place and checked it it, and then you did anupdate from SVN, bringing in the changes from someone else and SVN notesthat there are unresolvable changes.   Again, if you don't want your localchanges, remove the file and update again.  There might be a niceGUI-pointy-clicky way to do this (in fact, I'm sure there is, I just don'tknow what it is).Helpful?-- david d zuhn  Saint Paul Bridge & Terminal Ry.zoo @ stpaulterminal.org

Hello All,I set out to do something simple at the club and wound up with an unusable panel. No harm done, as I always save to a new file nameRunning r20055 on an XP machine. I changed 3 LocoNet turnouts from OneSensor to Indirect feedback. Saved the LE panel, closed JMRI and reopened. All the LocoNet stuff came up as Unknown, an error dialog popped up and I got the following exception in the consoleStevo     0 apps.Apps                             INFO  - ****** JMRI log ******* [main]    47 apps.Apps                             INFO  - This log is stored in file: C:\Documents and Settings\LMRC\JMRI\systemfiles\messages.log [main]  2625 PanelPro.PanelPro                     INFO  - PanelPro version r20055 starts under Java 1.7.0_03 at Sun May 13 19:17:48 EDT 2012 [main]  4063 locobuffer.LocoBufferAdapter          INFO  - COM4 port opened at 57600 baud with DTR: true RTS: true DSR: false CTS: true  CD: false [main]  4297 serialdriver.SerialDriverAdapter      INFO  - COM1 port opened at 9600 baud with DTR: true RTS: true DSR: false CTS: false  CD: false [main]  4453 serialdriver.SerialDriverAdapter      INFO  - COM3 port opened at 57600 baud with DTR: true RTS: true DSR: false CTS: false  CD: false [main]  4594 serialdriver.SerialDriverAdapter      INFO  - NCE COM6 port opened at 9600 baud [main]  4844 nce.NceConnectionStatus               INFO  - NCE EPROM revision = 6.2.0 [AWT-EventQueue-0]  4953 nce.NceConnectionStatus               WARN  - Detected 2007 March EPROM which doesn't provide reliable MONITORING feedback for turnouts [Transmit] 10719 miniserver.NetworkServer              INFO  - Server starts on address: 192.168.1.102 port 12080 [Thread-29] 22797 configurexml.ErrorHandler             ERROR - Unexpected error (Exception) while load(Current LMRC APB Panel.xml) in adaptor of type jmri.configurexml.BlockManagerXml Exception: java.lang.NullPointerException [AWT-EventQueue-0]java.lang.NullPointerException    at jmri.configurexml.BlockManagerXml.loadBlock(BlockManagerXml.java:231)    at jmri.configurexml.BlockManagerXml.load(BlockManagerXml.java:206)    at jmri.configurexml.ConfigXmlManager.load(ConfigXmlManager.java:573)    at jmri.configurexml.ConfigXmlManager.load(ConfigXmlManager.java:503)    at apps.configurexml.PerformFileModelXml.load(PerformFileModelXml.java:61)    at jmri.configurexml.ConfigXmlManager.loadDeferred(ConfigXmlManager.java:717)    at apps.Apps.doDeferredLoad(Apps.java:264)    at apps.Apps.access$000(Apps.java:53)    at apps.Apps$2.run(Apps.java:208)    at java.awt.event.InvocationEvent.dispatch(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.EventQueue.dispatchEventImpl(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.EventQueue.access$000(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.EventQueue$3.run(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.EventQueue$3.run(Unknown Source)    at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)    at java.security.ProtectionDomain$1.doIntersectionPrivilege(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.EventQueue.dispatchEvent(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpOneEventForFilters(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForFilter(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForHierarchy(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.run(Unknown Source) 92110 implementation.SignalSpeedMap         WARN  - attempting to set invalid speed: Block [AWT-EventQueue-0] 92110 implementation.SignalSpeedMap         WARN  - attempting to set invalid speed: Block [AWT-EventQueue-0] 92110 implementation.SignalSpeedMap         WARN  - attempting to set invalid speed: Block [AWT-EventQueue-0] 92110 implementation.SignalSpeedMap         WARN  - attempting to set invalid speed: Block [AWT-EventQueue-0]

Hi guys,I've held off on updating JMRI at our club for a good couple months now, not wanting to goof up our phone throttles. Our membership has taken quite a liking to them, with one even buying an iPad to bring out on club nights. The last posts which caught my eye talked about updating the installer to take care of an issue with the new Jetty web server. Is this worked out now?Also, 2.99.5 appeared on Jenkins several days ago. What's the word on its status or potential release date?On a somewhat related note ... Things have gotten pretty quiet lately on the Developers Group. I assume this is on account of normal spring/summer busyness. Speaking for myself, we're got a lot going at the club these days with our layout expansion in full swing, along with numerous projects to improve our club house and existing layout. In addition to our normal Thursday night meetings, we've got teams working on Mon and Tue nights, and an occasional Saturday. My day job also keeps me more occupied than normal, with various teething issues revolving around the building addition continuing to drag onStevo

I run into issues with trying to clear routes using entry-exit. One option would be having a separate sensor to click as a 'cancel request'. If I've setup a path, but then want to change it, I just try to click in reverse path, but many times I get both of ends flashing instead of the popup asking to cancel.Granted right now I'm spending more time 'showing off' the feature, so this is happening a lot. If I have the table open that has a cancel option but my screen is usually a bit busy.Or is there some special way to help deal with this??Now the other issue I have is ends of the layout has a set of triple track, three level staging elevators. I did some neat graphics to point the three tracks to the nine staging tracks, but for the entry-exit I suspect I'll need a set of hidden turnouts so there is a 'block connection path' for the logic to work. For testing I just ran a set of tracks on the panel from the triple to the first three staging tracks. I'm thinking treating the elevator as a set of three way turnouts will work for the blocks and routes best.But this is getting kind of special. The other bit here is debate about if we should treat the elevators as 3 sets of 3 tracks or as 9 tracks. One issue is that it has been difficult to keep the tracks all level so when you stop you can access all three tracks at the same time. We use a chain link counter for position and find that 'ideal' seems to be within 15 links from each other, but each a little different. Since there are a set of turnouts in front of the elevator as a throat, the user would think "I want staging #6 to go to main #2" and JMRI can figure what to set the turnouts and tell the elevator which level to stop at.-ken cameronSyracuse Model Railroad Club http://www.SyracuseModelRr.org/ CNY Modelers   cnymod.comFinger Lakes Live Steamers http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org/ Member JMRI Developer Team http://www.jmri.org/ mailto: kcameron@...

Thanks, Paul.That helps explain what I'm seeing.  I can successfully send functioncommands to the lead loco address, and I can successfully send motioncommands to the consist address.  But the Throttle control is not doingthat automagically.Sounds like I need to change EngineDriver to do the "send functions to leadloco address" bit.--SteveTOn Thu, May 10, 2012 at 1:00 PM, Paul Bender <paul.bender@...> wrote:> hi Steve,>> Sent from my iPad>> On May 10, 2012, at 10:28 AM, Steve Todd <mstevetodd@...> wrote:> > After creating a consist using Tools -> Consisting Tool..., pressing the> Throttle button (in the Consist Control window) opens a throttle with the> address of the first loco, not the consist address.

You can see my resulting panel here:http://jmri.mstevetodd.com:1080/frame/Waccamaw%20Coast%20Line%20.html  Theonly "after-processing" I had to do was create an image from the "text"layer in XtrackCad and assign it as the background image for the panel.Thanks,  SteveT

Hi All,After creating a consist using Tools -> Consisting Tool..., pressing theThrottle button (in the Consist Control window) opens a throttle with theaddress of the first loco, not the consist address.  The locos do notrespond to this address.  If I release and then acquire the consistaddress, the locos move as expected.  If I understand the Consisting Tooldocumentation, the consist is being created correctly, but the Throttlebutton should open a throttle for the consist address.I tried the same steps using JMRI 2.12, and the Throttle opened with theconsist address, and worked properly.Is this a bug, or am I doing something wrong?My environment:Ubuntu 12.04 -> JMRI 2.14 -> PR3 -> DB150 (same issue seen with Ubuntu11.10 / latest JMRI from Jenkins / DCS100)Regards,  SteveT

It has two states, stop and go. The transition rates between the two states are controlled by the decoder momentum settings. The control system has no idea what the decoder addresses of the locos are. It just says "I detect a train going east and the signal at the end of the block says 'Stop', so I had better tell the train it needs to stop.  ... 'Click'. OK, the signal no longer says 'Stop', I guess it is OK to let the train go again.  ... "Click'.Dick :)

If it drifts past that point then it takes off again because only the main blocks are controlled by stop relays. Also I am using Aspects and Masts, so 'distant' is not an option. Those were just tricks we needed to play to get SSL to act right.I'm going to ignore the whole issue for now and see if it will work using other changes. Also you need to know that JMRI is only controlling the signals. (using masts and aspects) The LNCP hardware logic is controlling the direction sensing and stop relays. There are no Logix statements involved, but I feel sure that it could be used in place of the local LNCP logic. JMRI just monitors the results (indications) of the local logic.Dick :)

It is the trailing point situation that is bugging me. The same logic that says that the facing point turnouts are part of the single track says that the trailing point turnouts need to be included on the passing tracks. I'm guessing that your phantom trains come from including the turnouts without any conditional on their positions.As I have mulled this over, I think that a series of checks that consists of simple ANDs should suffice. The situation where multiple sensors are involved in the same interlocking could be taken care of by simply adding additional simple AND checks. (e.g. a crossover)Dick :)

In this case,  add achecker to the ant build procedure, and make sure it fails the build whenthings are not as they should be.   Then once you have the checker working,wire it in as a dependency to the regular build procedure.   If it's overlyburdensome to make part of the regular build process, we can at least makeit part of the CI builds.  It's much better if it's something that peopleare likely to test before they check in their code.Make this easy for people to use, and people might do so.

Usually one direction of traffic is always routed into the siding and the other is always left on the main.  Trains in both directions go through one spring switch where the points are set against them in the normal route.Paul

Bob,When the turnout is against the direction of traffic, then it does not matter what its occupancy is. As you say, you are not going there.It is only when the turnout is aligned for your route that it needs to be counted as a part of your block. This is because the opposing signal is on the far side of it.Another example may make it more clear. If an engine is sitting on the OS between the masts which block is it in? Yours, the next block, neither, or both. The correct answer is both, and that is the issue.Dick :)On 05/06/2012 01:21 AM, Bob Jacobsen wrote:> On May 5, 2012, at 8:14 PM, Dick Bronson wrote:>>> Lets take the simplest example of a passing siding.

Kevin, Etc.,I'm having great fun trying to setup hardware based train stopping. In the process I have run into an interesting thing. I'm not sure if it is a bug, or an omission, but I think it did prevent my first attempt from working properly with closely following trains.In pairing up masts it is very easy to include all the intervening turnouts and sensors except for the last one! When considering the limits of a block it is not simply determined from one signal mast to the next in a pair. It is from one signal mast to the next OPPOSING signal along the chosen route. (or some such language)Lets take the simplest example of a passing siding. The first turnout is nicely accounted for by the pairs. However how do we account for the turnout at the opposite end of the siding. What is supposed to happen is that if the final turnout is lined for traffic, then its OS is also counted as a part of the block. However if the turnout is lined against the route, then its OS is considered a part of the other route, but not counted in this route.I do not see any way currently to do this. The thinking is that if the turnout is lined, and occupied, then the block is considered occupied because it might be a train entering the block. However if the turnout is not lined, then any occupancy is not related to the block in question, so it should be ignored. In the passing siding example this is not a big thing, but in a more complex interlocking it may be very important.I think what is needed is an option check for a sensor, conditional on the position of one or more turnouts. For a complex interlocking there may be several. I suppose if the user had multiple sensors in the interlocking it could also require an OR for multiple sensors. I.e. Check for (((Sensor1 - state) OR (Sensor2 - state) OR ...) AND (Turnout 1 - position) AND (Turnout 2 - position) AND ....)Dick :)

In my testing with Win8, I'm getting an error on startup and the 'send debug info' sends the other details but the console log is missing the NPE backtrace.At this time, that system is just using 2.99.4 but I think I could talk my wife into letting me load Eclipse and run the debugger to get more details.What I don't know is if the error itself leads to why the error isn't in the console log or not. Now I also went back and looked and while the NPE is shown in the console log window, it is not in the console.log file.This is the Win8 preview that's been out for a while, like a couple of months.jmri.util.PortNameMapper.getDetailsFromWinRegistry(unknown source)-ken cameron, CCP.Staff Leasing of CNY Inc 315-641-3600SkyDiver: Zoo-602, A-8596, D-11839.Skier: down & cross.

I'll be there most of the week. Between Op-Sig, LD-Sig, OpenLCB and JMRI it should keep me busy.Yes trying to herd a breakfast or two has been kind of a tradition. I don't think we've topped 10 people at once yet. I recall about 5 or 6 at any one time being the usual. So something early in the week like Tuesday and another on Friday morning would be the best bet to cover everybody likely to be there.-ken cameronSyracuse Model Railroad Club http://www.SyracuseModelRr.org/ CNY Modelers   cnymod.comFinger Lakes Live Steamers http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org/ Member JMRI Developer Team http://www.jmri.org/ mailto: kcameron@...

Stevo and all,I'll attend this year's NMRA convention, although I will likely be spending almost all of my time with the Operations Road Show clinic/layout in the convention Hotel.If you attend and can fit it into your schedule, stop by, say hi, and sign up for a  3 hour "Timetable and Train Order" operating session on our layout.  Spots may fill in quickly, so sign up early for best session choices.Perhaps we should also think about setting up a JMRI breakfast...  If there is interest, and noone else steps up to the plate, I can coordinate this.Regards,B.

Hi,just tried to run my scripts with the latest sources including the Jetty branch. Tey contain a number of interesting .properties files which I think people WILL even want to translate them, so I cannot ignore them.Unfortunataly my scripts at the moment simply freak out when importing Html.properties. (Infinite loop when reading the file)So for the time being my little translation utility is not useable until I have fixed the source of the freak out.SincerelySimon

I've got toget a test release build going again.I'm also looking at possibilities of moving CI (or portions of it) to theCloudBees FOSS CI service.   I've got a head of trunk build running therenow.  It's a linux host, so we can't move all of the builds to it (since wedon't get a compressed Mac OS X .dmg file from any Linux hosted build).We also won't get root permissions to do anything on such a build server.However, I may move the FindBugs and regular test builds there.  We mighteven get GUI tests run (as long as they're completely non-interactive).More to report later...-- david d zuhn  Saint Paul Bridge & Terminal Ry.zoo @ stpaulterminal.org

Running Netbeans IDE 7.1 (Build 201112071828) which will on occasion delete the JMRI projects (I have 2related to JMRI) from the project view after downloading SVN updates.  The JMRI project will briefly flash in the view on opening, then be gone.If File>Open Recent Project is selected, JMRI is shown, but if selected will state "The project is either invalid or deleted".If File>Open Project... is selected, it can find the first project JMRI -but not the second) but says the project.xml is not formed correctly before the root element.Anyone else having similar problems?  If not, any ideas?Rt.-- Bob True"Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch.  Liberty is a well-armed lamb contesting the vote." -- Benjamin Franklin

One more clue to use (if nobody mentioned it before as I'm still 128 messages behind since I was out doing live steam operations this weekend) is to see what LocoNet Checker thinks of the different OpSw values.One thing to be wary of within JMRI is if we somehow had the 'two wrongs don't make a right but three do' and somewhere one fix got in but due to other errors, that is now an error. So using our own monitor stands a chance of being misleading by having the same code doing the same wrong interpretation. At least there is the chance. So looking at the 'raw bits' should confirm if something is wrong there or not.-ken cameronSyracuse Model Railroad Club http://www.SyracuseModelRr.org/ CNY Modelers   cnymod.comFinger Lakes Live Steamers http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org/ Member JMRI Developer Team http://www.jmri.org/ mailto: kcameron@...

Ok this is a computer that manages our museum layout. After some number of days running, it (WinXp) says that 'PanelPro.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience' and when you click the windows prompt about the problem, JMRI goes away. Now I can use all of the windows of JMRI just fine, so those threads seem ok and running fine.But the details of the 'problem' says:AppName: panelpro.exeAppVer: 6.0.310.5ModName: rxtxserial.dllModVer: 0.0.0.0Offset: 000c455Exception InformationCode: 0xc000000dFlags: 0x00000000Record: 0x0000000000000000Address: 0x00000000039dc455And then a bunch of stuff like module listings and hex core dumps.Now this is running 2.99.2 on an older WinXp, A Celeron 2Ghz chip with 1.25GB ram.And it seems to do this regularly after 5 or 6 days of running. I suspect this is one of those Windows and related library memory leaks or something and that simply rebooting every few days will be the solution. But I figure I'd mention it in case anyone has other clues or needs a repeating fault to test ideas against.Oh, it is also a system that gets the "processing modified jar" followed by the "can't write cache file" error/warning while starting for all the jar files. I know we were looking for a case of this to track down what's wrong so that's a different problem (maybe) that we could trouble shoot here.The museum is closed today so I'm leaving the 'error' in place and not restarting until later in case any of our Windows types want me to look at other details.-ken cameronSyracuse Model Railroad Club http://www.SyracuseModelRr.org/ CNY Modelers   cnymod.comFinger Lakes Live Steamers http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org/ Member JMRI Developer Team http://www.jmri.org/ mailto: kcameron@...

Bob,I was trying to set my clubs DCS200 to a global default of 128 Fx mode.Looking at the JMRI Config tool, I assumed setting OpSw 21 to 'C' woulddo this (below are the switches as listed in the JMRI tool).21: Global default for new loco: FX22: Global default for new loco: 28 step23: Global default for new loco: 14 stepBy changing OpSw 21 to 'C', I had actually changed the default to 14step mode. Reading the DCS200 manual it showed that I needed to change OpSw 23 andleave 22 and 21 in the 'T' position. Further I downloaded and checkedthe DB150 manual and it showed the opposite of the DCS200 (OpSw 21 to'C' for 128fx).Somewhere along Digitrax has changed these switches. My original postshows the switch settings from the DCS200 and DB150 manuals. So not really a bug but a description issue. It's bedtime (gotta get up in 6 hours for work) so can try to answeranything else tomorrow. In a week or so, I can pull out the clubs oldDB150 to test and can test a DCS50 at the same time if needed.PeterOn Sun, 2012-04-29 at 19:07 -0500, B.

From: B. Milhaupt <dccexperimenter@sb...> - 2012-04-30 00:08:08
I'd like to understand this issue, but I'm not sure that I understand the problem.The message sequence in the jmriusers Yahoo group implies a lack of clarity in the LocoNet Command Station Configuration tool.  The JMRI bug report seems to imply that that the LocoNet Command Station Configuration tool needs to behave differently for DCS100 vs DB150.  Or perhaps it implies that the tool currently does behave differently but should not. From the above, I am not sure what the JMRI bug is.  In trying to figure this out, I did some investigation, and I conclude that there is bad information in some Digitrax documentation, and that the JMRI LocoNet Command Station Configuration tool does not need to be different when used with my DCS100 and my DB150.Here's what I have found:I do not see any existing command-station dependencies within the JMRI LocoNet Command Station Configuration tool, other than to select the appropriate .properties file.  The DB150 and DCS100 .properties files give identical definitions for OpSw 21, 22, and 23.If I set a combination of OpSw 21/22/23 on my DB150, then acquire a locomotive using a DT402D, I get a DIFFERENT operating mode than the one I expect from the Empire Builder document I have on my hard disk.  Current documentation on the Digitrax web site shows the same discrepancy versus the DB150 I have.  Bit-ordering reversal is evident.My experimentation shows that my DCS100 gives operating modes that are consistent with my DB150 for a given combination of OpSw 21/22/23 values.My investigation shows that I have an old Chief.pdf file and an old SuperChief.pdf file which have DIFFERENT definitions for OpSw 21/22/23 combinations, and that they are bit-order-reversed with respect to each other.  My DCS100 operates in a way that is consistent with the old SuperChief.pdf file I have, and inconsistently versus the old Chief.pdf file I have.  I find that the Digitrax web site has a "Chief II Manual.pdf" and a SuperChiefXtra.pdf file that are both consistent with my DCS100.  I find that the Digitrax web site has a "Chief manual DT100.PDF" file that is consistent with my old Chief.pdf file and inconsistent with my DCS100.DCS50 and DCS51 PDF documentation seems consistent with current SuperChiefXtra.pdf documentation.  I do not have easy access to either a DCS50 or a DCS51 to check the behavior of these command stations against the current documentation.The above leads me to believe that the JMRI bug report (as it is currently worded) should be rejected.But perhaps there is different behavior for different versions of DB150.   My DB150 is quite old, and perhaps older or newer DB150s behave differently.  Can anyone confirm DB150 behavior which matches the Empire Builder documentation for OpSw 21/22/23?Similarly, perhaps there are DCS100s out there that match the older documentation for OpSw 21/22/23 behavior.  Can anyone confirm such behavior?Current DCS100 documentation does not list "Motorola Trinary", or "28 speed steps with basic consisting" as options for OpSw 21/22/23, but these are defined in older documentation.  Have either of these features been removed in newer DCS100s?Once the discrepancy is understood, JMRI LocoNet Command Station Configuration tool changes can be made to avoid some of the confusion regarding these three bits.  It seems to me that the tool would be better if it were to implement a JComboBox to configure the possible values of OpSw 21/22/23.  Ideally this JComboBox would display only the legal values for a given type of command station.Since there doesn't seem to be a programmatic way to query the command station type using a LocoNet message, it seems that this change would have to rely upon the command station type configured by the user as part of the "Preferences" when the LocoNet connection was configured.I will tackle this once I have a complete understanding of the original problem report,FYI - I found a few curious things during the above investigations:I find that my DT400R incorrectly displays ONE operating mode, regardless of command-station type.  The combination that properly displays as "14" (baseline 14 speed steps) on my DT402D will give me a display of "28" (28 speed steps; basic consisting) on my DT400R.And I find that my DT300 and DT300R both work fine with my DB150 and LocoBuffer-USB (no other LocoNet devices attached), but both give the "flashing display" which "requests a trip to Florida" when used with my DCS100 and LocoBuffer-USB (no other LocoNet devices attached).  I hadn't heard of this kind of dependency before!Regards,BobAt 11:50 PM 4/21/2012, Peter Ulvestad wrote:>Walt,>>21=C, 22=T and 23=T will set a DCS 100/200 to 14 step mode (from>experience).>>Peter>>On Sun, 2012-04-22 at 00:46 -0400, Walter Thompson wrote:> > Peter:> > are they listed as 21,22,23 or 23,22,21?> > My guess would be for 128 FX mode its 21=C, 22=T and 23=T.> > But it could be just the opposite.> > Walt> >> >> >> > -----Original Message-----> > >From: Peter Ulvestad <ulvestad@...>> > >Sent: Apr 21, 2012 11:31 PM> > >To: jmri-developers <jmri-developers@...>> > >Subject: [Jmri-developers] Loconet Command station tool errors > for DCS       100/200/51> > >> > >I just submitted a bug report (#3520199) for the command station tool.> > >> > >While not really a bug, the tool descriptions for OpSw 21-23 are wrong> > >and caused me some headaches until I RTFM.> > >> > >>From the manual for the DCS100/200:> > >OpSw 21-23 set the global system default type for> > >"NEW" loco selections.

Pete,I am in a crash program to upgrade my RR to have automatic train stopping, hopefully in time for an open house tomorrow night ...oops... tonight. (using relays and diode blocking, not locomotive numbers)I'll gladly try it some time next week.Dick :)On 04/26/2012 09:55 PM, Cressman wrote:>  Dick,>>  I committed fixes for saving the MultiSensor default icon set after>  adding or deleting icon positions in Panel Editor.

Dick,I committed fixes for saving the MultiSensor default icon set after adding or deleting icon positions in Panel Editor. It should also fix the corrupted catalogTrees.xml file.If you wouldn't mind hanging your Linux system one more time could you send me the console output after attempting to add an icon from the Image palette in Control Panel Editor?   There ought to be a trace of failures that i may be able to see where the error is.Thanks.Pete--- On Wed, 4/25/12, Dick Bronson <dick@...> wrote:From: Dick Bronson <dick@...>Subject: Re: [Jmri-developers] Bug when saving Catalog trees.To: "Discussions between JMRI developers" <jmri-developers@...>Cc: "Cressman" <pgcressman@...>Date: Wednesday, April 25, 2012, 11:39 AM              Pete,    There be dragons. I tried using Control Panel Editor but every time    I try to place an item (not just a multisensor) on the panel it    locks up my Linux (not an easy thing to do) to the point where I    need to power down to reboot.

I am adding some automatic stopping                  hardware and                   needed some new icons to match, so I whipped up a                  direction arrow and                   stop button for PanelPro, and placed them in my local                  preferences                   folder. E.g. preference:resources/stop/west.gif After                  using the                   Multisensor window to add a few of the new items to my                  panel it offered                   to save them as my default. I was not done, so I said                  'Yes'. It then                   created the following entry in catalogTrees.xml.

Multisensor in panel editor looks screwed up.  i will attempt to fix.  btw, try control panel editor - it will allow you to keep multiple sets of icons for devices rather than just one default set.  (see menu Item Palette)Pete C.--- On Wed, 4/25/12, Dick Bronson <dick@...> wrote:From: Dick Bronson <dick@...>Subject: [Jmri-developers] Bug when saving Catalog trees.To: "Discussions about changes to the code; design, intent, etc" <jmri-developers@...>Date: Wednesday, April 25, 2012, 6:25 AMHi,I spun my wheels for a few hours yesterday after the Multisensor Icon Window went wonky.

(you don't even want to know how long this took me to figure out):<node nodeName="MultiSensor"><leaf name="MultiSensorPosition 2" path="program:resources/icons/USS/plate/levers/l-right.gif" /><leaf name="MultiSensorPosition 0" path="preference:resources/stop/west.gif" /><leaf name="BeanStateInconsistent" path="preference:resources/stop/stop-off.gif" /><leaf name="BeanStateUnknown" path="preference:resources/stop/stop-off.gif" /><leaf name="SensorStateInactive" path="preference:resources/stop/e-w.gif" /><leaf name="MultiSensorPosition 1" path="preference:resources/stop/east.gif" /></node>Once that entry had been created the MultiSensor no longer works. (It does not open its window properly, and when you do force it, much is missing) I do not know if this is a result of deleting the third position, but still having it saved, or that it can not locate the icons in the preferences area. The multisensors work fine, so JMRI is able to locate them without any problems for the panel.I am running under Linux Ubuntu and have not tried this under Windows.Dick :)

What is the procedure for adding patches and new/updated decoder definitions?  I see that we have a fair few decoder definitions to add dating back to the 24/12/2011.Is it a case of just adding them in? or are there more things that need to be done?RegardsKevin

The problem is that the message for a feedback encoder ( or a turnout with feedback ) can either be requested by a device or sent via an asynchronous broadcast message.On the lenz serial interfaces, the information that indicates whether the message was broadcast or is a directed message is stripped out by the interface.The problem occurs when a broadcast message and a directed message are delivered at nearly the same time during a period of very high network traffic, especially when more than one listener is registered to receive events of a particular type.

Here, we're making the distinction between doing that with invokeAndWait and invokeLater.  I don't understand Paul's point, because I think that Swing's rigorous ordering should allow invokeLater to work fine, which will in turn allow the transmit/receive process to continue while Swing is working (That's why transmit and receive have their own threads, after all)Many of the systems already use invokeLater in their handleOneIncomingReply() methods for queuing the notifications onto the Swing thread.  The parent handleOneIncomingReply() in AbstractMRTrafficController does use invokeAndWait. It was changed from invokeLater in CVS revision 1.9 in 2003 (!!).  The comment on that is "Change order of xmt and reply handling to avoid race condition". I don't remember anything more than that, unfortunately. The changes are more than just the invoke* method:http://jmri.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jmri/jmri/jmrix/AbstractMRTrafficController.java?r1=1.8&r2=1.9Not sure how to proceed.  Changing this might break things, but I think that's because they're already broken (in terms of synchronization) and this is just making it less visible.Bob--Bob Jacobsenrgj1927@... +1-510-486-7355 AIM, Skype JacobsenRG

The message stuck by theinvokeandwait eventually gets released when the swing thread becomesfree and the message gets sent out after a notification has been sentthat it had timed out.I did notice that opening a roster entry for programming does have anaffect on the processing of message replies.Ignoring this issue initially maybe my question should of been, whywould performing a "Read All Sheet", cause the swing thread to be incontinuous use.RegardsKevin

The "wait" part really does mean _wait_.   Try looking at> invokeLater()If I remember correctly, part of the reason for doing this with invokeand wait is to make sure that systems that require a response to amessage are finished handling the response before the next message goesout.  If you just replace the invokeandwait() with invokelater(), the currentdesign will allow the next message in the queue to go out to the commandstation before the just received response is fully handled.  This can beproblematic on certain systems Also, this is likely to make certain aspects of the automatic errorhandling in AbstractMRTrafficController fail because the currentoutgoing message may be replaced with the next one in the list beforethe type of response received is fully handled.Paul-- ______________________________________________________________________________	"Quality is a Characteristic of thought and statement that 	is recognized by a nonthinking process.

Hi,during the last few days I updated my translation scripts. Besides adding a lot of internal documentation and tidying up functions I also added a test function to check for a valid version number for all .properties files.From the 158 files 3 still contained an old CVS style version number while 25 did not have any version number at all. Also some do not contain any copyright info. My questions:1) Would it make sense to add or update all files without SVN number?2) Would it make sense to extend the test for ALL project files and not only the .properties files which are in my focus at the moment.3) Would it make sense to also check if all files contain a valid copyright statement?4) For all of the above is it recommended to branch out the version or may all files remain in the trunk as the functionality does not change?5) Any other test you think would be helpful for you using the same infrastructure?Simon

It's important that JMRI be able to grow by incremental inclusion of new & great things.

  I think the problem is similar to that with the design of menus within DP3, and why the DP3 menus look nothing like the old JMRI menus. The traditional JMRI start window menus are a bit of a mess.  They've grown over the years as people add something new onto JMRI.   Individually, any addition can be justified as "a small change and not to bad a fit considering what we have",  but collectively the result is messy.  The solution, but its not trivial, is to redesign the JMRI start window menus, to group things together better.  AND to remove things which are considered outdated (or at least push them down to a sub-menu of things which are nearly obselete).  A few things will need renaming.    That solution will have a degree of complaint from experienced users who have learned the old interface,  you will recall that DP3 had a load of complaint when it was first floated, but those seem to have disappeared and the few comments which are now seen are positive (see Microsoft Office 2003 to MS Office 2007, the transition for experienced users is initially difficult, though most seem to decide that the 2007/2010 interface is generally better once it's been learned). Randall has a fair point about "DP3" being a set of start preferences, and "PanelPro" being a different set of start preferences.   Possibly "Roster" or "Roster Manager" is the right term for the primary window in DP3,  though the term "Roster" is very American-centric.  - Nigel Walter Thompson wrote:  >Randall:>I see.

This helps a lot, Ken.Can your Apache server reach the JMRI server via your local network?  If so, using Apache's mod_proxy would solve your problem, by having the apache server retrieve specific URLs (/frame/*.png) from your JMRI server and return them to the client as if they came from the apache server itself.  Then include a meta-refresh in the apache page where you'd like the image to show (to keep it current).  Only proxy the image (png) files, to prevent a click parm doing anything (clicks are only processed for the /frame/*.html files).Let me know if you need me to setup an example on my servers.Regards,  SteveTOn Wed, Apr 11, 2012 at 1:22 PM, Ken Cameron <kcameron@...<mailto:kcameron@...>> wrote:John and Steve,The feature of setting in the index.html so only a ‘read only’ version of the frames was added, and that would work, except from what I played with you can’t have both available at the same time. And our problem is how to have one set of pages and web like tools for the ‘public’ while still having the set of fully interactive services for our own use. Now granted the local security is strictly the strength of the wireless router that is our hub for the layout.Right now what I’m thinking of, and would love some hints, is to have a process export snapshot (when there is a change) to an external website of some of the frames. So the public could see things like how many laps etc and the panel file showing where trains are around the layout. The biggest reason is so museum staff can see when things stop moving from their desks (mostly in the basement and other far away corners of the old armory building the museum occupies) and the second is for our own members to help spot when and where problems happen. The fact that things like this are considered big by the public as it would be ‘live’ viewing is secondary to us, but the museum considers that ways to add things like this to their website (Apache) would be a big plus.So at the low end of this is that most routers/firewalls let you set up mapping of one external port number to another internal port number so you can expose selective services, but from what I see we don’t have a way to tell JMRI to expose one view of things at one port number while exposing a similar but protected version via a different port number.So yes the goal would be that one port on the JMRI box is ‘public internet safe’ to expose selected view but have no interaction. But still have the fully interactive features of JMRI available on a different port that isn’t going outside our layout router so our own phones and tablets can operate the layout.I’ve had good success with a HP tablet (one of those they were dropping from production for $99) that my wife broke to Ice Cream Sandwich. It works for this rather nicely and a 7-9” touch screen makes a nice yard panel or an even better dual throttle.All indications say we will get there at some point with the work Randall is doing. But all those parts will still take time. So I’m also looking for clues of how to cob something together sooner if possible. Either some way to have a process on the JMRI box exporting ‘safe’ pages or someway to have another box on our layout pull the web pages, ‘sanitize’ the actions parts out of them, and then forward that to the ‘public’ web server or something like that.-ken cameronSyracuse Model Railroad Club http://www.SyracuseModelRr.org/<http://www.syracusemodelrr.org/>;CNY Modelers   cnymod.com<http://cnymod.com>;Finger Lakes Live Steamers http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org/Member JMRI Developer Team http://www.jmri.org/mailto: kcameron@...<mailto:kcameron@...>In the Upstate New York US area of the world---------- Forwarded message ----------From: John Plocher <john.plocher@...<mailto:john.plocher@...>>To: Discussions between JMRI developers <jmri-developers@...<mailto:jmri-developers@...>>Cc:Date: Wed, 11 Apr 2012 12:16:10 -0400Subject: Re: [Jmri-developers] New JMRI embedded web serverOn Wed, Apr 11, 2012 at 9:09 AM, Steve Todd <mstevetodd@...<mailto:mstevetodd@...>> wrote:Hi Ken,I'm trying to understand what you're asking for here.It sounds like the only "change/regression" is that the old default index page could be set to "read only" rather than having it have active controls on it:> At one point the frames exposure added a feature so you could write the> index.html to only show a read-only, but that was still on the same port.  -John------------------------------------------------------------------------------Better than sec?

Steve,Thanks, I'll confirm where the server sits and see if that's doable. If not we'll spin up one of our own and get it port forwarded to the public side.-ken cameronExcuse me, this was sent from my BlackBerry.From: Steve Todd [mailto:mstevetodd@...]Sent: Wednesday, April 11, 2012 02:25 PMTo: Discussions between JMRI developers <jmri-developers@...>Subject: Re: [Jmri-developers] New JMRI embedded web serverOK, cool.  This helps a lot, Ken.Can your Apache server reach the JMRI server via your local network?  If so, using Apache's mod_proxy would solve your problem, by having the apache server retrieve specific URLs (/frame/*.png) from your JMRI server and return them to the client as if they came from the apache server itself.  Then include a meta-refresh in the apache page where you'd like the image to show (to keep it current).  Only proxy the image (png) files, to prevent a click parm doing anything (clicks are only processed for the /frame/*.html files).Let me know if you need me to setup an example on my servers.Regards,  SteveTOn Wed, Apr 11, 2012 at 1:22 PM, Ken Cameron <kcameron@...<mailto:kcameron@...>> wrote:John and Steve,The feature of setting in the index.html so only a ‘read only’ version of the frames was added, and that would work, except from what I played with you can’t have both available at the same time.

Hi Ken,I'm trying to understand what you're asking for here.  The key (to me) is:Are you wanting to allow "public" users to connect to the JMRI Web Serverwith their own devices, or via the internet?  If not, then the currentserver should work fine, just lock/remove the keyboard and mouse.The following assumes you _are_ wanting to allow access via the internet,or other paths where the URL can be changed:Firewalls can allow or disallow traffic on certain ports, but they're notdesigned to filter traffic based on the content (such as whether or not apage request has a "click=" parameter.)  You need a way to remove or ignorethe "click=" parameter.  Of course, there are other URLs which can alterthe layout, such as /xmlio.  You need to block those as well.In Apache, you could use mod_rewrite and set up rewrite rules to strip offcertain parms, block certain paths, etc.  I _think_ this can even be donebased on incoming port or ip.Randall, will the jetty version include something akin to mod_rewrite,configurable by user?Regards,  SteveTOn Wed, Apr 11, 2012 at 5:24 AM, Randall Wood <randall.h.wood@...> wrote:>> On 11 Apr 2012, at 00:46, Ken Cameron wrote:>> > Randall,> >> > At the museum we have a layout and I built a simple display panel, see> attached, to show status of the trains running around it.

Instead, DP, PP, and other programs (Cornwall RR even!) get a Roster window in their roster menu.Randall WoodAlexandria Software202.683.8604randall.h.wood@...http://www.alexandriasoftware.com

Randall,At the museum we have a layout and I built a simple display panel, see attached, to show status of the trains running around it. It sits on the 'untrusted' network but the museum staff is on a separate 'trusted' network and the only contact is via the 'public' internet which is where us members would also like to monitor it.The issue is all the firewalls only deal with port forwarding and filtering, so we only want the 'public' side to see stuff but not be able to click anything. Yet at the layout we are using a couple of phones for throttles and a tablet for a mobile status and layout control. Those are on the direct network for the layout.At one point the frames exposure added a feature so you could write the index.html to only show a read-only, but that was still on the same port.

The actual hostname and ip address remain in the mDNS request, so this information should remain available. The real advantage is that a user sees "The Gorre & Daphetid" instead of "GorreDaphetid.local." as the system he's connecting to. I'm also reusing the railroad name in web pages, so it's consistent (at least on the web server).This also allows a modular club that does not own it's own computers to use any member's computer with the club name in the JMRI preferences.The Railroad name defaults to "My JMRI Railroad".Sent from my iPhoneOn Apr 10, 2012, at 17:52, Brett Hoffman <bhoffman351@...> wrote:> > On Apr 10, 2012, at 5:18 PM, Randall Wood wrote:> >>> I do have a couple of questions, though:>>> 1) WiThrottle is now broadcasting using the same "Railroad Name" set in the web preferences.

WiThrottle uses the machine name to store information on each device so that when the app connects it identifies its setup for that layout.

That is a very useful function to give up.  One key place it is used is with roster images.  Many of the roster images being stored in JMRI are 3Mb photos (or larger).

It's a lower level replacement, not a higher level decoration, because it _replaces_ the existing "send via …" behavior with a new "send via command station" behavior. True, but, if what you want to do is modify the behavior of how a turnout sends something to the layout, this is a convenient mechanism for doing so.In the raw case, we keep the system specific feedback mechanisms in place while changing the way the turnout makes the request to change the state of the layout.Paul

So what might need to happensomewhere is to only allow this option to be set where there is avalid command station for the turnout.Prior to the warning being issued, the system would always send theRAW turnout command out to the default command station, now the systemtries to find the appropriate one, if not falls back to using thedefault.RegardsKevin

If you build a simple system with CMRI/sim (node 0, SMINI) and NCE/sim, then add a turnout for each, set 'automatic retry', you will get a bug when toggling the CMRI turnout. The error message is:62204 implementation.RawTurnoutOperator     ERROR - No match against the command station for CT1, so will use the default [AWT-EventQueue-0] 87875 implementation.RawTurnoutOperator     ERROR - No match against the command station for CT1, so will use the default [AWT-EventQueue-0]So it seems that the 'retry' doesn't figure out that the CT1, shouldn't go to the command station.Anybody think they have the idea on this or should I dig into this??This is with 2.14, 2.99.3 and SVN.It looks like the issue is RawTurnoutOperator looks for CommandStation entries and of course CMRI doesn't have a command station.-ken cameronSyracuse Model Railroad Club http://www.SyracuseModelRr.org/ CNY Modelers   cnymod.comFinger Lakes Live Steamers http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org/ Member JMRI Developer Team http://www.jmri.org/ mailto: kcameron@...

> I suggest a bleeding edge test, alpha, and then just fixes to any major issues found. Followed by a Beta release to the group of 2.99.4Releases are like a well-scheduled railroad -- there's always anotherone coming down the line shortly.Rather than holding up a release for a non-essential patch, I suggestthat a 2.99.4 release be made, as is, or perhaps updating the branchto capture the current trunk state.   Don't worry about "I'll get tothose patches tomorrow" and hold things up.Getting a 2.99.4 release out now helps get work that's been checked ininto some level of testing.But this is also just a test release, so I don't think we need tocomplicate it with a whole series of alpha & beta releases.  Just cutthe branch, call it 2.99.4, perform the usual paper-bag checks, andshove it out the door.Do the same thing with the next batch of changes, and call it 2.99.5.Heck, even if there's a paper bag embarrassing change needed to2.99.4, fix the tree, make a new branch, and call the new release2.99.5.Then, on a train of thought that is separate from making a release,start looking at the patch queue.   Patches that are good go into thetrunk and then come out in a release whenever the next one comesalong.  They've been sitting in a queue anyway so they're clearly nottime sensitive.  But this way they're now sitting in a place wheresomeone else can perhaps see them as part of normal development, soit's an improvement.The key here is that updating the tree with external patches is not ablocker for making a release, it's a separate activity.You may choose to not issue a production release without whittlingdown the patch queue, but that's not a particularly good reason tostop the entire release train.  You bottle up everything when you holdup a test release.-- david d zuhn  Saint Paul Bridge & Terminal Ry.zoo @ stpaulterminal.org

Thanks, Randall.I think this is great!  I gave it a quick look today, on Windows 7 andUbuntu (now online at http://jmri.mstevetodd.com:1080).Here are a few minor things I noticed:1) I was auto-starting the old web server, and got an error until I removedit from prefs, and added the new start option.2) On Windows, I get an error rebuilding the index file.  Looks like it'snot handling the slashes correctly?  I will debug further when I get time.3) The /frame/xx ajax pages didn't work (my fault) as I had recently movedto a new version of jquery and forgot to change that reference.  I havefixed on trunk and on your branch.4) The image resizing (minHeight, minWidth) has been removed/disabled.  Isthat temporary?I also tried to compile it on my Windows machine, and noted the following:1) I had to manually add a number of jetty-related .jar files to my buildpath.2) I get a single compile error:The method getParameterMap() is undefined for the type HttpServletRequestJmriJFrameServlet.java /jmri/java/src/jmri/web/servlet/frameimage line 220 JavaProblemAgain, thanks for working on this.

Kevin,Yes my issue was coming from Logix and not being clear about what a signal mast should do about aspects. I had thought (from discussions long, long ago) that somewhere we had a way that a mast would know that if asked to display some aspect it didn't know, it would have a 'best fit' that it would display. This solved the 'ranking' issue of signals so when designing a signal mast it would accept all aspects, but filter it down to what it could display that would be equal or more restrictive than the one requested. I see now that's not the direction we ended up implementing. It would have been a rather interesting 'web' of relationships and in those discussions we couldn't think of a clear way to represent that at the time.-ken cameronSyracuse Model Railroad Club http://www.SyracuseModelRr.org/ CNY Modelers   cnymod.comFinger Lakes Live Steamers http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org/ Member JMRI Developer Team http://www.jmri.org/ mailto: kcameron@...

Ken,I am referring to the Signal Mast Logic, not Logixs.  So is your question in the previous email relating to Logixs?The Signal Mast Logics can either be dynamically created using the layout editor or you can manually define a signalmast logic.RegardsKevinOn 26/03/2012 16:41, Ken Cameron wrote:> Kevin,>> In this context you are meaning the 'Signal Mast Logic' which ties> them all together and not Logix which is not aware of the same degree> of restrictions and is able to make those 'invalid' requests??>>> -ken cameron Syracuse Model Railroad Club> http://www.SyracuseModelRr.org/ CNY Modelers   cnymod.com Finger> Lakes Live Steamers http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org/ Member> JMRI Developer Team http://www.jmri.org/ mailto:> kcameron@...

Kevin,This is starting to gel better. Now a quick question and maybe this is the clue. When writing a Logix, it doesn't know to restrict the list of aspects per the signal mast being used in the action??At least that seems to be the trap I've fallen into, I've got logix trying to set 'clear' but some things don't know what a 'clear' is only something like 'slow clear' for example. Now it could also be I've made edits to the logix overtime like indirectly like changing a signal from one type of mast to another and the aspect isn't valid anymore, but was for the mast at the time the logix was created.-ken cameronSyracuse Model Railroad Club http://www.SyracuseModelRr.org/ CNY Modelers   cnymod.comFinger Lakes Live Steamers http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org/ Member JMRI Developer Team http://www.jmri.org/ mailto: kcameron@...

It is up to the calling software to know that signal can't do something like 'clear' or whatever and pick from what it knows.Yes and that can be found by doing a getValidAspects() against themast in question.> The 'aspect mapping' is for the next signal relationship. Granted it doesn't take into account things like grades, curves, distances, etc... to cancel out invalid matches when the next signal might be too close or would be wrong given those other circumstances.True, but it does take into account block speeds and turnouts, i'venot yet seen the example that would deal with grades/curves ordistances.  Having said assigning the appropriate speed against ablock or turnout, should I would imagine deal with these.> The signal head editor then allows us to further reduce the available aspects on a head by disabling them.The signal head editor wouldn't as there are signalmast that can drivephysical outputs directly and skip the creation of a signal head.unless of course you are refereing to the edit option against eachsignalmast, that allows you to disable specific appearances if you sowish.> But that would seem to make things worse on how often we'd have the case of how to map from one part saying 'clear' please but the best available on the head might be 'advance' or whatever. I don't currently see where that matrix exists clearly.The working out is all done by the SignalMast logic, it looks at thestates of the blocks, turnouts associated speeds and available aspectson current mast and picks the best choice.RegardsKevin

Hi Ken, I'll take a stab at this- 1st you define all the aspects in the aspects.xml for the particular signalling system. While doing this you can attach a speed to an aspect and/or routing (normal, diverging or either)- In the appearances files you define in the 1st section (appearances) which aspects are valid for a particular mast- Then in the next section (specific appearances) you define which aspects are used for the "system" aspects (danger, held, permissive and dark)- Finally in the last section (aspect mapping) you create the matrix for what appears on the mast you are defining in response the mast aheadHere's our club system with a fully featured mast and a stripped down mast. On our spurs I have the block speed set to Restricting so we get the flashing red to warn the crews that someone forgot to put the turnout backBefore diving into the whole system here are a couple highlights:For our two head with advance we have 3 possible aspects in response to a Stop ahead. For the spurs I mentioned, we'll get a Restricting since that's the best available with a block speed of Restricting, for a siding we'll get Diverging Approach since that's the best available with the turnout set to Diverging and/or a block speed set to Medium, for the main we'll get ApproachThis mast supports the diverging aspects. In the mapping section the Diverging Approach maps to Advance Diverging Approach, while the Advance Diverging Approach maps to a Clear or Diverging Clear depending on the track layout ahead

 I've a question which I think I've asked before, but can't find the answer (except for "can't be done at present").  I am looking at a decoder definition file.   The CV in question can take approx 120 possible values.  They approximate to the followingCV400 =  0 through 28, means map to Function Key F0 to F28CV400 = 29 through 58, means map to Function Key F0 in Forward Direction to F28 in Forward DirectionCV400 = 59 through 87, means map to Function Key F0 in Reverse Direction to F28 in Reverse Direction.CV400 = 100 to 128, means map the inverted input to Function Key F0 to F28 CV400 = 129 to 158, means map the inverted input to Function Key F0 in Forward Direction to F28 in Forward DirectionCV400 = 159 to 187, means map the inverted input to Function Key F0 in Reverse Direction to F28 in Reverse Direction. (And this happens 29 times to cover another layer of function remapping) I could present the options as a massively long single drop-list, running to approx 120 entries.   But, I think a better presentation would be some check boxes or shorter drop lists to select the direction of operation and the inversion of input, then only 29 options on the final list.   Problem is the XML code in the decoder file - can I structure things so that a given checkbox or short drop list will add 29 or 59 to the selected CV value, and also add 100 (plus the 29 or 59) to the value.     I know how to do it if it is an addition in a single bit using masks,  but this is a decimal addition.   It might be possible with conditional statements which then hide/reveal bits of UI; eg. "if selected forward direction, then display second menu of options" or even "if selected forward direction and inverted, then display...." Is this possible within current decoder structures ?    If so, can someone give me a code fragment or file to look at ?   - Nigel

Control Panel came into being when enhancing Panel Editor functionality was messy due to both Panel Editor and Layout Editor being the same object. (loads of conditional statements etc).  I pulled out common code to an abstract Editor class allowing each editor to be subclassed. Subsequently some enhancements were made to Panel Editor that precluded some interface changes I wanted to do.  At that time there was a clear preference for the current PE UI, so I subclassed Editor to Control Panel Editor.  There is a small user group that wanted occupancy detection and automated train running for iconic panels.  These features are built into Layout Editor and require the vector graphics it uses.  Detection and routing is tightly interwoven in LE, so the Occupancy Block Tables are needed outside of LE.  CPE provides editing tools to support occupancy and auto trains on iconic panels.  Among the differences between PE and CPE are:1. CPE does click and drag. (right click not needed. This is consistent with standard Windows applications. I don't know what the Linux and Mac standards are.)2.Attributes can be changed for entire groups. (if the attribute applies to an item in the group, it is changed -  otherwise no change to the item)3. CPE uses Drag and Drop in many places where PE is "select location, then select operation".4. There is an "Item Palette" which can hold multiple icon sets for a given device type.  The palette is customizable for users.5.The palette supplies "Indicator Track" Icons that show occupancy and automated train status.6. Panels can be moved back and forth between CPE and PE - Even allowing Indicator track icons created in CPE to function on a PE panel.There may be other differences that I don't recall at the moment.  There is another subclass of Editor called Circuit Builder.  This is a work in progress to provide a GUI to create OBlocks, Portals, and Paths.  There are plans for CB to provide design help for interlocks and NX panels.Pete C.  ________________________________From: Randall Wood <randall.h.wood@...>To: Discussions between JMRI developers <jmri-developers@...>Sent: Tue, March 20, 2012 3:24:57 AMSubject: [Jmri-developers] Panel TypesWhat's the difference between a Control Panel and a Panel?As far as I can tell, the only difference is whether or not a Panel Editor window is displayed with the panel.

It's based on the same underlying structure as the "Panel Editor", creates the same underlying objects, but used a different structure to the editor GUI for creating and editing those objects. It was optimized for representing e.g. rectangular-grid control panels, CTC panels, etc, and not so much toward representation of arbitrary arrangements on the screen.

 Perhaps I wasn't totally clear.   I meant the difference between "panel" and "control panel" is mostly in the presentation of the editing toolkit; and its primarily a User Interface issue.  The writer of one wants things one way, the writer of the other a different way (and then the writer of the Layout Editor has a third way).  The confusion is made worse by many small incremental additions/changes to the toolkits; there is a tendency to stick a new feature on somewhere and never really look at the fundamental presentation of the total collection of features/tools; this is a generic issue over the whole of JMRI.   - Nigel  >________________________________> From: Randall Wood <randall.h.wood@...>>To: Nigel Cliffe <ncliffe@...>; Discussions between JMRI developers <jmri-developers@...> >Sent: Tuesday, 20 March 2012, 11:03>Subject: Re: [Jmri-developers] Panel Types>  >Maybe I should clarify.>>In the New Panel... menu, there are three options: "Control Panel Editor", "Layout Panel Editor", and "Panel Editor".
