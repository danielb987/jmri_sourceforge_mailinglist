I have downloaded things from other web sites before, so my guess is that's possible to scrape the archive without too much trouble. My question is what to do with the archive if I scrape it? Is it possible to transfer the archive to groups.io? I see that groups.io has an "Easy Groups Transfer" but that is only for Yahoo and Google groups.Regards,Daniel2018-08-05 22:59 skrev Bob Jacobsen via Jmri-developers:> > B) There doesn’t seem to be a way to move the message archive either.> > For (B), I think the best we can do is to point to the existing> archive at https://sourceforge.net/p/jmri/mailman/jmri-developers/> unless somebody wants to write some code to scrape that.

Due to issue #5359 and PR #5604, null profile is no longer valid. ProfileManager.getActiveProfile() will now throw an exception instead of returning null if there is no current profile. Therefore new tests may break if they don't setup a profile. This results in a NullPointerException: "NullPointer activeProfile is null". This can be solved by adding a call to resetProfileManager() in setUp().Example from jmri.configurexml.LoadAndStoreTestBase.java:@Beforepublic void setUp() {     JUnitUtil.setUp();     JUnitUtil.resetProfileManager();     JUnitUtil.initConfigureManager();     JUnitUtil.initInternalTurnoutManager();     JUnitUtil.initInternalLightManager();     JUnitUtil.initInternalSensorManager();     JUnitUtil.initMemoryManager();}https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/5359https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/5604RegardsDaniel

Bob,The results of these tests are inconclusive. There was still a delay even after the font checks had concluded. The delays seem to have moved around some.Something else has broken with R2f3476e. There are no events at all logged as 'R:'. (from the layout) Everything shown has an 'S:' indicating it is from JMRI. There is still a traffic burst on the bus, and the aspects are all shown correctly, so it is apparently just a traffic monitor glitch. The monitor also still has a substantial delay between when the traffic happens and when it appears in the display.When a turnout is changed on the layout (with a local button) it triggers off a string of events that appear immediately in the traffic monitor window. (with no noticeable delay at all) The panel updates immediately as well. Also all the events are tagged as 'R:' so the traffic monitor operates normally at that point.Using the panel icon to throw the same turnouts also acts and displays all the events instantly as best as my mouse click to eyeball reaction time can tell. The 'S:' and 'R:' tags are as expected. One 'S:' followed by a number of 'R:' entries as the signals react. (signal logic is in the nodes)How is the monitor different when recording the producer consumer query data as the panel loads, and when processing normal events? Is it monitoring the actual traffic.I'm going to have to drop out of this testing for tonight. Karen expects me to pack up the layout so we can head out for KC tomorrow AM.Dick :)On 08/02/2018 06:49 PM, Bob Jacobsen via Jmri-developers wrote:> Do I understand correctly that it does get the right results on the screen?>> A few seconds to open and parse the file, then a few second really busy period to do all the sensor/turnout/signal creation I/O, then putting up the panel sounds about right.>> Don’t know why the monitor activity waited so long after, though.

Do I understand correctly that it does get the right results on the screen?A few seconds to open and parse the file, then a few second really busy period to do all the sensor/turnout/signal creation I/O, then putting up the panel sounds about right.

Bob,Now I'm really puzzled. I started JMRI, then setup the monitor to log events. I then opened the panel. It essentially opened immediately showing all the correct aspects which it had to get from the layout.Then several seconds (4-5) later it wrote a burst of information to the monitor window. The repeat data seems to be gone. Here is a sample.17:25:54.815: [[19547ce8] 02 01 57 10 00 06 00 06]  S: 02.01.12.FE.67.8F                     Producer Identified Unknown for EventID:02.01.57.10.00.06.00.0617:25:54.833: [[19547ce8]

Thanks!There are several places in the code that reference the signal specification files. Eventually, I’d like to centralize this so that things like this don’t happen.But a question arises:  How to handle definitions that are in both the program and user directories?  Which gets precedence?  And should that be precedence in part (look for each file in one place or the other) or completely (take the signal system from just one place, even if additional files are in the other place)?  I don’t work with enough custom signaling to know what’s best.Bob> On Aug 2, 2018, at 1:39 PM, Dave Sand <dave@...> wrote:> > Build 22 resolved this issue.> > Dave Sand> > > >> On Aug 1, 2018, at 11:23 AM, Dave Sand <dave@...> wrote:>> >> The aspect numbers are being set properly for both standard and custom signal systems.>> >> Changing the aspect numbers and saving the changes works for standard systems but creates a Java exception for custom systems.>> >> <Screen Shot 2018-08-01 at 10.50.58 AM.png>>> >> The problem appears to be that the Mast Type is missing, probably causing the Java exception.>> >> The attached file is different this time.

I logged and timed the identify producers and consumers process, and it was 1.091 seconds for 10 double headed masts, 4 turnouts, and 12 blocks. Many sections of the log showed about 15,000 messages per second. That appears to make OpenLCB about 20-25 times the data rate of DCC.

Bob,I tested on build #22. Sorry for the delay in responding. I proceeded to remove all the old entries and the unused turnout entries just to be sure when testing.I pronounce it cured! The cleaned up panel loads correctly, and it is so fast that it appears to load all the mast's aspects virtually simultaneously. In the past, at least on my machine it would load, then change the 'X' entries to valid entries one at a time as you watched.I suppose that all your refactoring work has helped improve the load time, and the OLCB data rate can't hurt any either. I logged and timed the identify producers and consumers process, and it was 1.091 seconds for 10 double headed masts, 4 turnouts, and 12 blocks. Many sections of the log showed about 15,000 messages per second. That appears to make OpenLCB about 20-25 times the data rate of DCC. I didn't realize that it was that fast.Also there seems to be a lot of duplication in the log:13:26:08.907: [[1954438c] 02 01 57 10 00 06 01 E8]  S: 02.01.12.FE.54.1A                     Producer Identified Valid for EventID:02.01.57.10.00.06.01.E813:26:08.907: [[1954438c] 02 01 57 10 00 06 01 E8]  S: 02.01.12.FE.54.1A                     Producer Identified Valid for EventID:02.01.57.10.00.06.01.E813:26:08.908: [[1954438c] 02 01 57 10 00 06 01 E8]  S: 02.01.12.FE.54.1A                     Producer Identified Valid for EventID:02.01.57.10.00.06.01.E813:26:08.962: [[1954738c] 02 01 57 10 00 06 01 E8]  S: 02.01.12.FE.54.1A                     Producer Identified Unknown for EventID:02.01.57.10.00.06.01.E813:26:08.963: [[194c438c] 02 01 57 10 00 06 01 E8]  S: 02.01.12.FE.54.1A                     Consumer Identified Valid for EventID:02.01.57.10.00.06.01.E813:26:08.963: [[194c438c] 02 01 57 10 00 06 01 E8]  S: 02.01.12.FE.54.1A                     Consumer Identified Valid for EventID:02.01.57.10.00.06.01.E813:26:08.963: [[194c438c] 02 01 57 10 00 06 01 E8]  S: 02.01.12.FE.54.1A                     Consumer Identified Valid for EventID:02.01.57.10.00.06.01.E813:26:08.963: [[194c738c] 02 01 57 10 00 06 01 E8]  S: 02.01.12.FE.54.1A                     Consumer Identified Unknown for EventID:02.01.57.10.00.06.01.E813:26:08.963: [[1954738c] 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00]  S: 02.01.12.FE.54.1A                     Producer Identified Unknown for EventID:00.00.00.00.00.00.00.0013:26:08.963: [[1954738c] 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00]  S: 02.01.12.FE.54.1A                     Producer Identified Unknown for EventID:00.00.00.00.00.00.00.0013:26:08.963: [[1954738c] 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00]  S: 02.01.12.FE.54.1A                     Producer Identified Unknown for EventID:00.00.00.00.00.00.00.0013:26:08.963: [[1954738c] 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00]  S: 02.01.12.FE.54.1A                     Producer Identified Unknown for EventID:00.00.00.00.00.00.00.0013:26:08.963: [[1954738c] 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00]  S: 02.01.12.FE.54.1A                     Producer Identified Unknown for EventID:00.00.00.00.00.00.00.0013:26:08.963: [[1954738c] 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00]  S: 02.01.12.FE.54.1A                     Producer Identified Unknown for EventID:00.00.00.00.00.00.00.0013:26:08.963: [[1954738c] 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00]  S: 02.01.12.FE.54.1A                     Producer Identified Unknown for EventID:00.00.00.00.00.00.00.0013:26:08.963: [[1954738c] 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00]  S: 02.01.12.FE.54.1A                     Producer Identified Unknown for EventID:00.00.00.00.00.00.00.0013:26:08.963: [[1954738c] 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00]  S: 02.01.12.FE.54.1A                     Producer Identified Unknown for EventID:00.00.00.00.00.00.00.0013:26:08.963: [[1954738c] 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00]  S: 02.01.12.FE.54.1A                     Producer Identified Unknown for EventID:00.00.00.00.00.00.00.0013:26:08.963: [[1954738c] 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00]  S: 02.01.12.FE.54.1A                     Producer Identified Unknown for EventID:00.00.00.00.00.00.00.0013:26:08.963: [[1954738c] 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00]  S: 02.01.12.FE.54.1A                     Producer Identified Unknown for EventID:00.00.00.00.00.00.00.0013:26:08.963: [[1954738c] 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00]  S: 02.01.12.FE.54.1A                     Producer Identified Unknown for EventID:00.00.00.00.00.00.00.0013:26:08.963: [[1954738c] 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00]  S: 02.01.12.FE.54.1A                     Producer Identified Unknown for EventID:00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00Is this real or some artifact of the logging process?Thank you so much for improving all this.Dick :)On 08/02/2018 11:09 AM, Bob Jacobsen via Jmri-developers wrote:> Thanks!

There were a couple of missing and/or incorrectly coded checks in the original code in that area.  I think I’ve now found them all, but you never know….Fixes are in the branch on GitHub now, and installer #22 should have them shortly.Thanks again, much appreciated.Bob> On Aug 2, 2018, at 8:10 AM, dcc2 <dcc2@...> wrote:> > Thanks for the build @bobjacobsen.

Thanks for the build @bobjacobsen. Was waiting for the MatrixMast to take shape.Playing a bit, found a small issue creating a 2nd new mast and at that point copying settings using the “Copy Signal Mast Matrix from Mast” drop down and clicking “Create mast”:No mast is created.Could be the original code, or something in the new way.Choosing this popup on an existing mast showed no errors.EgbertStack trace:2018-08-02 16:36:24,287

Thanks!  The detail really helps, as I had managed to confuse myself about what you were seeing.The problem was that the Identified/Identify messages weren’t being properly emitted.  (The tests only checked after startup, not during startup, so didn’t catch this).I think this is fixed in the #21 installers at http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/TestReleases/job/SignalMast-development/  That’s currently building, should be done in a few minutes.Bob> On Aug 1, 2018, at 7:14 PM, Dick Bronson <dick@...> wrote:> > Bob,> a.)

Ken,Once the OLCB signals act as a peer node, then I think that you can probably do away with any scripts to poke things into responding. The OLCB protocol seems to be pretty good at dealing with random startup order. I think the OLCB masts should be able to use the same messages as the turnout and sensor tables do. The signal nodes respond properly with the active aspect's event info.I never noticed it because I had all the same EventIDs in turnout commands originally. As many have already found, those old entries tend to hang around in the panel files long after they are needed, so things appeared to be working fine with the new OLCB masts. It was only when I started to clean out the no longer used turnout entries that I discovered any issues.Dick :)On 08/01/2018 10:56 PM, Ken Cameron wrote:> Dick,>> If that's the case, it might explain why one part of the layout works> differently from the other.

Bob,a.) A JMRI panel is started first, signals etc. are all shown as unknown on the panel. Then the layout is started up. Signals, turnouts, sensors, all report their last states to JMRI as they power up, and the panel updates to match the layout. This works as expected.b.) The layout is started first, or already running. Then a JMRI panel is loaded. Turnouts and sensors are queried by JMRI and their panel images update. (as expected) However the signal images remain as unknown until something else causes them to change. E.g. logic in JMRI, logic in another copy of JMRI, or logic on the layout. In the latter two cases the signal state is already known and the panel needs to find it out, but can not.When our OLCB signals power up they always default to the last known aspect. If node based logic is controlling them, then they may change based on finding local conditions to be different than when the layout was powered down, or maybe the layout was not powered down at all when JMRI was restarted for some reason. (like making changes to a panel to get ready for a clinic presentation) <VBG>My understanding of the situation is that; the panel does not 'update' itself (display proper aspects instead of 'X') because it does not 'query' the events used for the signal aspects. This is one sentence, not two different thoughts one vs another.I have come to that conclusion because when the same EventIDs were duplicated in a turnout table, then it worked properly, apparently because the turnout table queried the events, and the OLCB mast saw the results. As I removed these old duplicate entries from the turnout table, it stopped the panel icons from updating. (synchronizing, whatever) At first it was only one, then two that failed.

The Cloud is only used to sync the multiple local copies.Sent from my iPad-- DaveThe New England Convention 2018http://www.newenglandmodelrailwayclub.com/content/convention.shtml> On 2 Aug 2018, at 1:46 AM, Ken Cameron <kcameron@...> wrote:> > Does Dropbox work over a local area network that is never connected to the> real world?

The simple clone for> simulation should be off the same index page I figure.For multiple profiles, you don't clone the user data. You move the data to a common location (a folder you create any where).You follow the Dropbox instructions exactly but instead of creating a "C:\Users\xxx\Dropbox\JMRI\" folder you create something like "C:\Users\xxx\Shared JMRI Files\". That's the only difference.Once you've configured your JMRI as per those instructions, it's only a matter of seconds to create new profiles using the Profile Copy command. The data sharing is automatic.I have 10 or more computers/VMs sharing my JMRI files via a Dropbox folder. If I take my laptop to a show, I just have to make sure I connect it to the Internet at some subsequent stage to propagate any changes.A multiple-profiles help page would be Step 1 of the Dropbox instructions with two or three words in the first two sentences changed, plus a new Step 2 that says something like: "go to Preferences->Config Profiles , select, Copy, restart and change connection settings.

Ken,A custom signal mast system.  The first one I did was a clone of SPTCO-1930.  It was enhanced and modified to meet the layout owner’s requirements.It uses the DCC Signal Mast Decoder driver with RR-CirKits SignalMan boards.

The aspect numbers are being set properly for both standard and custom signal systems.Changing the aspect numbers and saving the changes works for standard systems but creates a Java exception for custom systems.The problem appears to be that the Mast Type is missing, probably causing the Java exception.The attached file is different this time.  It is a complete profile and includes the custom signal mast system, a panel xml file with two masts and the session.log file with the Java exception.The custom signal mast system, SPTCO-2018, is a copy of SPTCO-1930 with only the names changed and the icon references changed from ../../../ to program:.Dave Sand> On Aug 1, 2018, at 12:09 AM, Bob Jacobsen via Jmri-developers <jmri-developers@...> wrote:> > Thanks again!> > I think I’ve got some fixes for this in #19 at http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/TestReleases/job/SignalMast-development/  which is building now and should be complete shortly.> > Not entirely sure I go the problem with the custom signal definition.

Dave,Does Dropbox work over a local area network that is never connected to thereal world? By taking the computers home, I can have them online forupdates, or I use USB drives to bring updates to the club.I'm thinking a similar page for the case of live vs simulated would be moreuser friendly.

The trick is to move User Files Location (and Roster Location) out from within Profile Location. The technique for doing this is described in detail (with illustrations) in our Dropbox help page. The process is the same irrespective of where the destination folder is:<http://jmri.org/help/en/html/setup/Dropbox.shtml>;Once you have done that it's simply a matter of highlighting the existing profile in Preferences->Config Profile, right-clicking and choosing Copy. Once you restart into the new profile you can simply change the connection type. This can then be done ad infinitum to create as many profiles as you desire (I probably have around 20).Sent from my iPad-- DaveThe New England Convention 2018http://www.newenglandmodelrailwayclub.com/content/convention.shtml> On 1 Aug 2018, at 9:37 PM, Ken Cameron <kcameron@...> wrote:> > I think you've posted a checklist for how to clone a profile, like setting> up a simulated connection, and get all the other paths changed correctly.> Did it ever get added to the JMRI website?

Ken,I was thinking of Bob Jacobsens idea to have a dialog box that only allows the user to quit or start a new profile. I was interested to see if I was able to implement that, together with my idea of a button that would allow the user to change only the connection settings. I'm not sure I'm able to do it, but I'm interested to give it a try.And in order to figure out how to do that, I was trying to figure out what is happening then JMRI starts and where this particular code should go. I'm quite new to JMRI development so I have a lot to learn. But it seems to me that the connections are set up by JmriConfigurationManager at line 183 and that the error handling is some lines later. So what I'm tryin to figure out now is how to see if JMRI has valid connections and whenether these are able to open the ports.My goal with the dialog box is four things:* A quit button* A new profile button* A change connection button that doesn't allow changing any other settings except the connections.* A clear information message to the user that the problem could be because the connected device is unplugged or power off.RegardsDaniel2018-07-16 05:25 skrev Ken Cameron:> Daniel,> > Spinning all those messages is not useful, but neither is trying to do > much> if your system connection is broken/off/disconnected.

I was looking at what is happening when JMRI starts without being able to open the port, because the LocoBufferUSB is unplugged. I then noticed that I get about 64 warning messages every second in the NetBeans output window that says:loconet.LnPacketizer  WARN  - xmtHandler.notify() npe [LnPowerManager LnTrackStatusUpdateThread]It's only a warning message so it's not a big deal. But there is a lot of them and they continue to come until I quit JMRI. I don't know if these messages end up in the log, since I watch them in the output window in NetBeans. But I get curious about why something continues indefinitely trying to do something on LocoNet when there is no LocoNet connection, because the LocoBufferUSB is not plugged in.The reason for me to react on this is because these messages becomes spam that hides all the important stuff in the output window. With these messages, I have over 3000 messages in the output window, but without these messages I only have about 45 messages in the output window. But it's no big deal since I can quit JMRI and copy the contents of the console window to a text editor and watch the important stuff in the editor.My configuration is a Digitrax Zephyr Extra and a LocoBufferUSB. But LocoNetUSB not plugged in at the moment. JMRI version 4.13.1ish+daniel+20180716T0229Z.RegardsDaniel

One thing that would help the user a lot is a clear information message that this error could be because the SPROG/Commandstation/LocoBuffer is not power on or not connected to the computer.A message that tells the user that the port is not available does not nessesarily tells the user what is wrong. A message that tells the user to check whenether the commandstation/sprog/locobuffer is connected and power on would help many users, including myself.It's easy to think that the user is stupid, but I have made a lot of very stupid errors myself. And a reminder to connect the sprog and power on the sprog helps.------Another question:Would it be possible for JMRI to do a simple test of the port when the user saves the settings? Lets say the user had selected Digitrax Zephyr connected with a LocoBufferUSB. Then JMRI could open the port and read slot 1 before saving the settings. That would give a hint whenether the port and the central is correct. If the answer from the port is bad, either the central unit or the port is wrong and JMRI could warn the user that something is wrong.RegardsDaniel2018-07-14 03:53 skrev Bob Jacobsen via Jmri-developers:> Absolutely agree the solution I mentioned is flawed.

Dan,I'm sure we'd welcome that. I don't have time to delve into it.In the past few days I discovered that the USB-based systems accept but ignore NCE's A2 Consist Control commands.The A2 Consist Control commands on the Power Pro do two things:1) Update the command station's Consist Table.2) Send an NMRA S9.2.1 Consist Control instruction to loco(s) as appropriate.We can fudge (1) with memory access commands but (2) is a problem. The USB-based systems don't have a sendPacket command so we'd have to fudge by sending POM CV19 commands instead.The behaviour of Consist Control commands in the decoder versus POM CV16 can differ between decoder brands/models. For example ESU decoders allow Consist Control to change CV19 in a locked decoder, but POM CV19 is disallowed.Sent from my iPad-- Dave in AustraliaThe New England Convention 2018http://www.newenglandmodelrailwayclub.com/content/convention.shtml> On 15 Jul 2018, at 10:08 AM, Dan Boudreau <daboudreau@...> wrote:> > Thanks Ken,> > I'll take a look at the NCE stuff and see if I can figure out how to fix it.> > Dan

I suggest that the log always shows the date and time when the connection was last changed. If a user changes the connection and then tells you that something doesn't work, you will at least see when the change of the connection was made.I suggest that when the settings are saved, JMRI does a check to see if anything in the connection settings has changed and if so, saves the date and time.RegardsDaniel2018-07-14 03:53 skrev Bob Jacobsen via Jmri-developers:> Absolutely agree the solution I mentioned is flawed.

Sounds good (though I have no idea at all where to start setting this up).The current tool is simply a .jar file, run from the Terminal using flags for a range of options.There was a separate discussion in PR #7 on integrating the function of XCR into PP, but that would require versioning of the XCR jar first. For now that's just another reason to use the GH Release system.

I would like to see Daniel's suggestion implemented.With C/MRI, if you change the connection, you lose your defined nodes when doing the Save as the whole connection definition is written out to the file.

And in response to Ken's question, no. The Internal is selected and remains that way on a subsequent restart, even if all the "Save" offerings have been declined.I don't know if in fact it is secretly doing a Save, or if it clears the Defaults on restarting - I'll investigate more.I appreciate the need to have a Simulator situation - it deserves its own deliberately created profile, which is what I believe most people do.I also very much appreciate the need to be able to set a new Port (Thank you so much, Windows!) as this catches out many users.What I do not understand is why Internal is selected when the immediate previous condition was not that way.

Bob,I think one of the issues here is that if a port wasn't valid when JMRIstarted, we don't have a way to say "invoke the method that finds all theports". If the code could finally do this, we could say we didn't find whatwas configured, but give a prompt about the problem. The user could try tocorrect the physical issue (plug it in, turn it on). Then hit the 'tryagain' button.Unfortunately it is much simpler to exit and try again.With the defaults, I think our issue is we currently change it to a workingconnection (Internal when all else failed). Preventing changes to thedefaults, except by user direct action, might be a way. But part of thiswould be requiring them to review the defaults every time the connectionschange. But as I recall, right after you add a connection, it doesn't existuntil you reboot, so it isn't in the defaults list yet. Or is this betterthese days?I'm just trying to think of different ways of thinking about this conundrumand hope either I or someone reading this with find a better way than how itworks today.-Ken Cameron, Member JMRI Dev Team http://www.jmri.org http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org http://www.cnymod.com http://www.syracusemodelrr.org

It's covered by creating a new profile for the new port, albeit with more work for the user.The key is the message we give the user. Explain that the configured port is not available and they can quit - fix the port problem - restart or create a new profile using the new port.We also need to ensure that the failing profile is not set to autorun without showing the profile selector.Andrew------ Original Message ------From: "Dave Heap" <dgheap@...>To: "Discussions between JMRI developers" <jmri-developers@...>Sent: 14/07/2018 01:22:47Subject: Re: [Jmri-developers] Defaults (was Re: First 4.12 files available>But as it stands, your suggestion has a flaw.

I suppose that this is about the issue I wrote about on 1st May 2018:"I have had problems with the JMRI when using USB ports.After many problems as the computer (Windows or Ubuntu)seems to pick new USB ports as "a lottery" and the resulthas been that JMRI is dropping off turnouts and some otherrequired items at new starts.I have moved to Ethernet connection (I do not know ifTams is supporting Ethernet) as it is reliable if youdo remember to start the Ethernet first in your network.ESU ECoS and JMRI and MERG support Ethernet connections.With Ethernet you may have 4 concurrent connections.I think it is a bug in the JMRI if it really drops outitems you have been using earlier. I do not check thatany more as I am using only Ethernet connection to JMRI."There should be a message to start over and pick up theright USB port before the JMRI does anything for your file.Kai "Waiski" Vehmersalo, Finland###On 14.07.2018 07:32, db123@... wrote:> I would appreciate your solution a lot.>> About the question about the wrong port:>> Maybe it would be possible for your dialog to have a button "Edit > Connection" that shows ONLY the connection dialog in the settings > dialog.

Absolutely agree the solution I mentioned is flawed.  As far as I know, _all_ solutions have the same underlying flaw:  Some JMRI users are going to not understand their options when something unexpected & out of the ordinary happens.  For example, let’s say there’s a special case for changing just the port.  Now somebody forgets to plug in their SPROG, and does the obvious thing, which is to switch the preferences to the other visible port, perhaps a built-in modem, and save them.  Completely reasonable thing from their point of view:  The port info got lost, and I just restored it to the obviously-correct choice!  All good!  Oh, wait, still not working. I’ll start a JMRI users thread on “PanelPro suddenly can’t talk to command station” and not mention I changed the port selection until my 12th post.Similar with any kind of auto-simulator approach:  It’ll work for some people, but it’ll fail in subtle ways for others because the simulators are never going to be perfect.  (Two-sensor turnout feedback anyone?)  In my opinion, you’ll have harder support issues if you try to chase that.We’ve been around this discussion enough times without finding a solution that works for all cases that I now believe there probably isn’t one. But I certainly could be wrong.  It would be great if somebody wanted to code an alternative that we can build and have people try it.Bob> On Jul 13, 2018, at 5:22 PM, Dave Heap <dgheap@...> wrote:> > Bob,> > I'd back a version of your solution any day.

Bob J,You would not be the only one in favor of that solution. The only other tool that would be nice to go with that is a one button tomake a 'Simulator' version of whatever profile you have, sharing everythingelse with the existing profile.

We have simulators and profiles for the "away from layout" situation.Fallback to Internal is causing us too much ongoing support load and much user frustration.But as it stands, your suggestion has a flaw.

Hi KenActually its not that much code and the warning only appears for every tenon-off, or off-on states has happened. A lot of newer sensor hardware has this built in. A classic example of its useis Pizza Cutter wheels sending sensors  high for a micro second or two on nearbytrack, or small outages on the loco when its cruises on the flywheel sending thesensor low.Steve G.> ---------- Original Message ----------> From: Ken Cameron <kcameron@...>> Date: July 6, 2018 at 8:31 PM> > > Steve G,> > So the flapping message is anytime there is bouncing of the raw input?> Granted in my case with the longer interval, it is likely to have a higher> number of counts.

Copy Conditional:  Great idea and a very useful tool on the route toeventual reusable JMRI code.My CTC environment has about 20 basic conditionals replicated an average of70 times each.  Some are replicated only a 8 - 10 times and a few over 100times.  Copy Conditional is a great place to start.  Eventually I hope wecan have a passed Conditional Data Structure that contains all thereferenced variables, but Copy Conditional fits right in with the concept.I reviewed the project description below and it brought me back to thecurrent reality of how irrational and difficult to deal with the JMRI Beantable environment has become.  Paul Bender is (I think) adding the GUI toBob J.'s Event Mast (Turnout Mast like, but with Events).  I wonder if thesupporting Event table will be a new public Event table of a hidden privatetable.David ParksLos Altos, CA-----Original Message-----From: Chuck Catania [mailto:cpcrr@...] Sent: Saturday, July 7, 2018 8:17 AMTo: Jmri-developers@...; Dave SandSubject: Re: [Jmri-developers] 4.13.x ProjectsDave,I would like to see a Copy Conditional function added to Logix.I envision this function presenting the selected conditional parameterswith drop down pick lists for each of the table objects in the AntecedentVariables and Consequent Actions panes.

See my post earlier - for me the issue is that in the edit sensor and edit block dialogues you can't enter valid values that are accepted in the table view.  One to two seconds is not an unreasonable inactive debounce value for a block detector and at the moment you cannot enter anything over 1 second - an arbitrary value which must have been introduced in error at some point.This is a regression, because it used to work fine in earlier versions of JMRI.I agree that it is not urgent enough for 4.12 as there is an easy workaround for users,  but IMHO we should fix it during the next release cycle.On 07/07/2018 01:31, Bob Jacobsen via Jmri-developers wrote:> I agree that we should show the actual value properly.

In the "industrial controls" industry, they design using a variety of "timer relays" which have different timing behaviors.  Two varieties are called "on-delay" and "off-delay", and these seem to relate to the topic at hand.  If I recall correctly, an "on-delay" relay (I may be using the wrong name here) waits for the "delay time" after the relay is powered before the coil energizes.  The power must be provided continuously during the "delay time" in order for the coil to become energized.  If the relay power goes away before the delay time, the coil remains de-energized.  As soon as the relay power disappears, the coil will de-energize.  An "off-delay" relay (IIRC) actuates the contacts as soon as the control input becomes powered, and remains closed for a time after the control input is de-powered.Ken seems to be describing a scenario where "off-delay" relay functionality is appropriate.  But the previous descriptions of JMRI functionality sounds like a logical-OR combination of "on-delay" relay functionality and "off-delay" relay functionality.  Using JMRI's "debounce" functionality would therefore seem to miss the desired functionality.JMRI "debouncing" of the motion detection input(s) may be a good part of the solution if spurious "false-motion" and spurious "false-non-motion" indications are seen.  A small "debounce time" of 100ms or 200ms could be suitable.  But Ken's basic functionality would seem to be best implemented using Logix.  A conditional would monitor the input(s).  An action "On Change To True" would propagate the input change (i.e. "motion seen") to the output sensor/turnout via a "Set Sensor/Turnout" action -and- a "Reset Delayed Set Sensor/Turnout" action (to stop the "off" timer).  Another action, "On Change To False", would perform a "Delayed Set Sensor/Turnout" with a delay of 60 seconds.I have made use of this basic construct many times in creating a highly-prototypical CTC implementation as well as a few other applications.(Now I'm wondering if Logix could/should include "canned" implementations of industrial-controls-style timing relays...)RegardsBob M.

When you’ve use debounce for it’s proper purpose, debouncing an input, you’ve never seen the “flapping message”.  And when you use it for something it’s not meant for, for which it’s likely to be unreliable, it warns you with this message.  Did I get that right?Sounds like the message is doing it’s job. It warns that changes are happening up the end of the timeout, such that the timeout isn’t sufficient to detect bouncing in that input.Bob> On Jul 6, 2018, at 5:31 PM, Ken Cameron <kcameron@...> wrote:> > Steve G,> > So the flapping message is anytime there is bouncing of the raw input?> Granted in my case with the longer interval, it is likely to have a higher> number of counts.

HiFlapping is when it doesn't stay on or off. So sensor is triggered and if still on after x millisecs it's considered on. If it goes off again and on again during that period it's flapping, it doesn't know whether to reset the timer or ignore. It's not intended for the purpose to which you have assigned it. If I under stand correctly you need a timer that resets on every sensed  interrupt.Steve G.On July 6, 2018 7:04:23 PM EDT, Ken Cameron <kcameron@...> wrote:>In this case I was considering an internal sensor that was the OR of a>couple of motion sensors around a layout.

I had a quick play, and a similar problem arises when editing the sensor debounce values in editing a block.In the sensor table, you can enter values in the thousands of milliseconds no problem - as Ken reports.If you edit a block, and go to the Sensor tab, it adds the comma separator as mentioned by Ken, but also the maximum value it will accept is 1000 (when it adds the comma) but if you enter 1001 or greater, the value just reverts to what was there before. I suspect this is using the same entry routine as the one that Ken found.It is quite normal to have longer inactive delays on block detectors, I set mine to typically 2 or 3 seconds.  I know this used to be fine, because I set up a lot of my block sensors that way, but I don't know at what version this ceased to work properly, it certainly isn't right now - although the workaround of doing it in the sensor table is simple enough.And of course, there will always be specialised applications where you might want a really long sensor off time, such as the 60 seconds that Ken mentioned, so we shouldn't be restricting its value to anything other than what the underlying variable can store.Regards,PeteOn 06/07/2018 16:57, Ken Cameron wrote:> I did some playing, I think there is an issue between some parts displaying> with separators (thousands) and some parts not.>> If I edited it via the table display, it doesn't show the separators.

Please do your work on some branch _other_ than the master branch)*) Shorter - might not find things, but can get back to our usual processHow about 10 days?Bob--Bob Jacobsenjacobsen@... +1-510-708-5988 AIM, Skype JacobsenRG

The creation of a UUID is a one-off operation (per machine/OS partition) when moving from V4.10 or earlier to a UUID-based V4.11.x or greater release.The migration will then happen once-off for each profile opened on that machine.There is a preexistent issue (before UUID) with reading the User Files Location from the old UserPrefsProfileConfig.xml file:https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/5184I suspect that is related to https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/5474The loss of stored window positions from a migration is probably related to when the migration copy occurs within the startup and preferences procedures but I wouldn't relish trying to unravel that. It's of the nature of a one-off inconvenience.Sent from my iPad-- Dave> On 29 Jun 2018, at 1:00 AM, Bob Jacobsen <jacobsen@...> wrote:> > Thank you for the detail on this.> > If anybody thinks this is a killer problem, please comment, otherwise we’ll go forward with this as part of 4.11.8> > Is this a permanent migration (i.e. there’s not expected to be any changes from now on, this is just the way it is), or a temporary thing pending another update?

One thing that bugs me about this bug, the rest of the screens on the maincomputer also stop updating. The trains stop moving, other Logix drivenevents stop updating. Even something simple like updating a count in amemory using a script line in a Logix stops updating it seems.I can understand something in Json causing the remote panels to fail, butthis is also causing the main panels to fail (freeze as doing updates).-Ken Cameron, Member JMRI Dev Team http://www.jmri.org http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org http://www.cnymod.com http://www.syracusemodelrr.org

My usual set of tests worked as expected, including the LE line size changes, except for some minor node identity issues.The node identity change has different side effects based on the profile history.If the profile structure contains the UserPrefsProfileConfig.xml file (the predecessor to user-interface.xml) and the user files location has been moved out of the profile, then issue #5474 will occur.  This is a one time issue and can be resolved by doing a stop and re-start.If the profile structure does not contain the file, the user-interface.xml copy drops any classPreferences entries (normally message suppression requests) and all windowDetails entries except for the current windows which have reverted to their default locations.  For most people, this is just a matter of moving the windows and reselecting any class or window specific options.For people who regularly move between JMRI versions, the transition from a MAC identity, such as 4.10, will result in a new UUID identity.

I agree that including it will prevent the type of 'what's going on' typemessage from the users. Just this morning a user was asking/complaining that4.11.7 made the panels look different. I see including it (#5481) willprevent this type of noise for the support team.So I recommend we remove the tag for 'after next release' and add it for4.11.8. The change is simple enough to view that I feel evaluation of 4.11.8will not likely require a 4.11.9.-Ken Cameron, Member JMRI Dev Team http://www.jmri.org http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org http://www.cnymod.com http://www.syracusemodelrr.org

From: Pete Brownlow <pete@up...> - 2018-06-26 06:44:35
Agreed that it is a minor cosmetic change, and the user impact of not including it could be major for some users with panels migrating from 4.10 whose panels will no longer display correctly.  Whilst the work around for the user is not too difficult, it is most likely to affect the less experienced users who are not using blocks, who are less likely to understand what the problem is and how to fix it.Therefore to avoid breaking the display of existing panels migrating from 4.10, I would really like to see #5481 included - it is a very simple fix and I argued for it to be in 4.11.7 but as Dave says, we just missed the deadline.Regards,PeteOn 25/06/2018 22:45, Dave Sand wrote:> Correct, this is a very minor cosmetic change to minimize user impact.>> Dave Sand>>>> On Jun 25, 2018, at 12:21 PM, Ken Cameron <kcameron@...> wrote:>>>> Ok, Dave's comment about #5481 sounds like my definition of 'fixes' to>> 4.11.* changes to minimize impact on existing users.

Ok, Dave's comment about #5481 sounds like my definition of 'fixes' to4.11.* changes to minimize impact on existing users. At least it sounds likethe current 4.11.7 would create issues for existing users (4.10 and prior)where things look different to them while the user hadn't changed anything.-ken c

I think one consideration for the release target timeframe should be the NMRA convention. The updates to C/MRI in 4.11.x are being presented in two clinics specifically focused on promoting JMRI to the C/MRI community.A user needs to understand what advantages progressive releases provide to their specific environment.Chuck Catania

#5481 is an interesting problem.It missed 4.11.7 by 24 hours due to discussions with PeteB.Its purpose is to minimize the visual impact of track changes for Layout Editor panels migrating to 4.12.  Without it, track without block assignments becomes very narrow.A detailed document is going to be posted to the user group files area with the release of 4.12 describing the changes to Layout Editor track drawing.  If people actually read the release notes and this document, this PR is not important.  In fact, it becomes unnecessary and can be cancelled since 4.13.1 is too late.I don’t see holding 4.12 for another 10 days.Dave Sand> On Jun 25, 2018, at 10:11 AM, Bob Jacobsen <jacobsen@...> wrote:> > We’ve accumulated a number of PRs for possible inclusion in JMRI 4.11.8.

It seems that the key question (which I have due to the cloudy history ofthese updates) is how much of them were new features vs fixes to things donein the 4.11.* cycle that have disrupted existing users? If we've separatedthe bits that were cures to side effects of the development cycle, and thosewere in 4.11.7, then I see leaving them until 4.13.1 is the right path.However, if we are faced with those 'fixes' for existing users are notseparate, and can't be, then I'd agree that we'd need a 4.11.9->4.12 insteadof 4.11.8 being the 4.12 candidate. I'm just thinking scope of change and ifit is 'fixing' known compatibility issues, it is more likely to expose othercompatibility issues when we put it out there. OTOH, if either way we havefewer support issues that what 4.10 turned into (defaults=>Internal) then,maybe we'd be ok. I'm just hoping we don't have the fallout like 4.10 seemedto turn into.Keeping other things for 4.13.1 is fine, since it will be out a month beforethe NMRA convention. I might add we consider that a 4.13.2 might be besttimed for just before the convention IF a number of changes are  added thatdirectly relate to content presenters are using for the convention. Here I'mthinking is issues related to the OLCB signal mast and related items comeup.-Ken Cameron, Member JMRI Dev Team http://www.jmri.org http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org http://www.cnymod.com http://www.syracusemodelrr.org

With release 4.10, some of the color handling was changed from menu selections or combo box selections to the Java JColorChooser.  This was mostly in the Layout Editor domain.  This change removes the limitation of using the 13 named colors in the Java Color class.Now that nearly unlimited colors are available, what if a person just wants Red?

These are modelrailroaders who are dabbling into software, not paid software engineers whocan be expected to follow particular processes.The advantage and thing that I like about the kernel style of> branching is that while your master branch may always be changing, the> release branches only need to pick and choose what they pull back.>This works well enough when you have frequent releases, many helpers, andsufficient history to be able to reject changes because the commit doesn'tstructure well into this workflow.The other thought with this is how exactly are versions numbered?It's certainly not semantic versioning.   In production releases, Bob hasbeen reluctant to got releases to update z (in x.y.z).   In the testreleases, z is just an increment since the last release, with no particularmeaning.y gets bumped each "major release" (even being production, odd being testreleases leading towards the next production [y+1]).x gets incremented whenever Bob gets convinced that it's worthincrementing.

Just a few thoughts for you based off of my experiences.One thing that you could do would be to follow a gitflow workflow[1]to separate branches and how they work together.  I've never followedthis workflow(I personally think that it's stupid) but it's certainlyanother option.What I generally do is to keep 'master' as the main branch ofdevelopment, and create a new branch for each release.  This is verysimilar to what happens with the Linux kernel.  For example, fixes arefirst applied to 'master', and can then be merged into the otherbranches as required.  Here's a concrete example: I fixed a driver inthe kernel and it first appeared in the 4.11 kernel series[2].  It waslater backported to the 3.16 series[3].  The other thing to note aboutthe kernel updates is that you don't do a pull request directly toLinus himself; you do a pull request or a patch to the maintainer ofthe subsystem, who then passes it up to Linus after it passes themaintainer's check(this is almost certainly overkill for JMRI).The advantage and thing that I like about the kernel style ofbranching is that while your master branch may always be changing, therelease branches only need to pick and choose what they pull back.Now this may not be super relevant for JMRI unless there is somethought into keeping specific versions(e.g. 4.10.y) up to date forpeople to use.The other thought with this is how exactly are versions numbered?  Ifthere is a semantic version[4](which is more geared towardslibraries), what do the different JMRI versions mean exactly?  Ididn't see a clear guide on the JMRI website(I found it on the DCCwiki), but generally my philosophy is to do a micro release for smallfixes, e.g. something like a misspelling, or bug fixes, no newfeatures.  Doing it that way generally means that your minor versionnumber will increment faster than it is now though, but it helps tokeep it separate in my mind at least as to what is going on.-Robert Middleton1: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow2: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/commit/?h=linux-4.11.y&id=2cd29f2387be70de9feb4c9f8dbc7c0bd55748ce3: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/commit/?h=linux-3.16.y&id=ffb5929e9f0810383ed5095338e78447da5140bd4: https://semver.org/On Thu, Jun 14, 2018 at 9:26 AM, Bob Jacobsen <jacobsen@...> wrote:>> For the past two production releases, we’ve been using an approach where we build the last few test releases sequentially.

Hi,I have been frustrated for a time that the splash window often opens too short to fully display the [Help] and [Quit] buttons. I drag the bottom of the window down, and then exit, only to have it be to short again the next time it opens.Someplace someone else also claimed the same issue and was told to simply resize the window and it would remember when saved. As an experiment I did that, and discovered that apparently there is a bug in the save because every time it is saved and then reopened again it is shorter than the last. I went a hunting and discovered that the data is saved in user-interface.xml. Running a diff shows the following changes for three consecutive closes.<window xmlns="" class="apps.gui3.dp3.DecoderPro3Window:DecoderPro" height="440.0" locX="2085.0" locY="75.0" width="745.0"><window xmlns="" class="apps.gui3.dp3.DecoderPro3Window:DecoderPro" height="413.0" locX="2085.0" locY="103.0" width="739.0"><window xmlns="" class="apps.gui3.dp3.DecoderPro3Window:DecoderPro" height="386.0" locX="2085.0" locY="131.0" width="733.0">It appears that the PanelPro splash screen loses 27 pixels height and 6 pixels width each time it is closed.Version 4.11.7Ubuntu Linux 16.4Dick :)On 06/12/2018 11:42 AM, Bob Jacobsen wrote:> First JMRI 4.11.7 files are available in the usual way at:>> http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/TestReleases/job/4.11.7>> Feedback appreciated.

For the past two production releases, we’ve been using an approach where we build the last few test releases sequentially. For 4.11 -> 4.12, this was going to play out as 4.11.7 being the last from master, and that fixes after that (i.e. to a 2nd set of 4.11.7 files, or to 4.11.8) would be created _on_ _the_ _4.11.7_ _branch_.  That would let them cleanly merge, while also allowing people to create and merge general-development PRs that would eventually end up in 4.13.1.  Git is good at this kind of separation.Unfortunately, I don’t think we can actually make this work.  Many productive people are used to working off “master”, and changing their process at this point isn’t really in the way that they think. People just normally make a change on “master”, whether it’s an incremental fix to 4.11.7 or is intended for general development (hence appear in 4.13.1); thank puts it on top of everybody else’s merged changes to master, so it can only be reliably brought into 4.11.7 with those other changes.For 4.9 -> 4.10, the process took a _really_ long time to converge, and it’s already started to look like that’s happening again.So for 4.12, we'll be using different process, starting now:0) I’ll rebuild 4.11.7 from the (new) head of master once the most recent PR (#5368) has been merged.1) After that, we _DO_ _NOT_ merge any PRs between now and the release of 4.12 in three weeks.  Yes, that’s a pain, but it’s the least available pain I can think of given how people work; would love to hear of a better one for next time!1.A) As a reminder, maintainers should please add the "After Next Production Release” label on new PRs.2) If you have a fix that should go in to 4.11.8 (10 days from now), please PR it and mention it here.  Because we’re not merging anything else, we can merge just the PRs that are needed for 4.11.8 and build that from master (sort of a “from a master that we’ve restricted the changes in”)3) Then we’ll build 4.12 from 4.11.8 (or 4.11.9 if that’s needed), and merge all those outstanding PRs to start the next test release series.This process is not risk free.  Because we’re not merging, we can start accumulating conflicts in changes.  This has caused problems before.  It would be great to have a better methodology that is both (a) compatible with how people work and (b) allows work that's to-become-the-production-release _and_ is-general-development-for-next-test-release  independently.   Suggestions welcome.  Hopefully we can come up with something better for next time (December).Bob--Bob Jacobsenjacobsen@... +1-510-708-5988 AIM, Skype JacobsenRG

Walt,Turn off "Show Empty CV Tabs" in Preferences->Roster->Programmer. That will hide empty panes.If a definition writer takes the trouble, it is possible to put in a dummy empty pane explaining why that particular pane is blank and where the appropriate settings are. For an example, look at an ESU LokSound V4 decoder with and without "Show Empty CV Tabs" enabled.I added these features quite a few years ago and all is explained at:<http://jmri.org/help/en/html/apps/DecoderPro/CreateDecoderAdvanced.shtml#pane_best_practice>;Sent from my iPad-- Dave> On 13 Jun 2018, at 7:27 AM, Walter Thompson <walter.stanley.thompson.3@...> wrote:> > Looks good on Digitrax DCS100.

I've been using 4.11.6 with the large West Ealing Layout Editor panel.  I've come across a couple of issues with display and usability of panels loaded from older versions with the new track drawing facilities.I've created these issues:#5447 <https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/5447>; #5448 <https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/5448>;I have also found some issues with the new track decorations feature:#5449 <https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/5449>#5450 <https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/5450>; #5451 <https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/5451>; #5452 <https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/5452>;The first two are important to fix before the next production release, IMHO, because they affect how existing user's panels will display in Layout Editor when they load them in the new version. In particular, #5447 <https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/5447>; can make some aspects of editing quite difficult.The remaining 4 issues are less critical, as decorations is a new feature few users will be using it yet and they are aesthetic issues, so I think they could wait for 4.13.Thanks,PeteOn 07/06/2018 15:51, Bob Jacobsen wrote:> JMRI 4.11.7 is intended to be the last “everything from HEAD of master” test release before we start stabilizing things for the summer production release.>> Are we about ready for building it this coming weekend?>> Small changes and bug fixes can still be added for a bit more time, but no big changes will be added to the production-release sequence after JMRI 4.11.7 (they can of course still go into Git and be in the JMRI 4.13.1 test release that comes out at about the same time as the production release)>> So if you’re working on a big change and need just a bit more time, please mention it here to start a discussion.>> Bob> --> Bob Jacobsen> jacobsen@... +1-510-708-5988 AIM, Skype JacobsenRG>>> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------> Check out the vibrant tech community on one of the world's most> engaging tech sites, Slashdot.org! http://sdm.link/slashdot> _______________________________________________> Jmri-developers mailing list> Jmri-developers@...> https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jmri-developers

(Some) Windows users need this optionjvm.args=-Djogamp.gluegen.UseTempJarCache=falseto prevent a really slow startup of the Audio table(s), which causes a really slow startup of all tables due to the pre-loading.IMHO, the right way to fix this is to get rid of the table preloading. Is it really optimal to condition access to e.g. the Sensor table on preloading all the other tables, including the problematic Audio, just so the common table window doesn’t have to resize?  Particularly since the window size and position are remembered _anyway_?  But given that we’re going to keep doing that, some Windows users need the UseTempJarCache setting.  We do it for all Windows users in the LaunchJMRI.exe procedure.But we can’t do it (yet) as a standard part of the development setup, because it kills Travis CI and some individual setups when it’s added to e.g. Ant’s build.xml. See https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/3880  So we say that people who need it should put that option in a local.properties file.Somebody has now suggested that we automatically create a local.properties file with the line as part of git checkout.  That doesn’t work, because (a) that file is supposed to be _local_ (hence the name), and (b) it’ll cause problems for all non-Windows users (who do the vast majority of the JMRI commits).But it might be possible, if somebody with Windows expertise and a test system wants to, to figure out how to put it into Ant’s build.xml in a windows-specific way so that it only acts there, and to also put it (in a Windows-specific way) into the setups for Eclipse, NetBeans, etc.Or is there some better solution?  Maybe have something (Ant? JMRI itself?) issue a reminder if running on Windows without the line in the local.properties file or set some other way?

Hi,While trying to answer a user question about how to send EventIDs to change a signal aspect I discovered a disconcerting format mismatch. You can easily do a 'Copy' of the EventID from the CDI. For example '02.01.57.10.00.08.01.A8', but if you paste that into the 'OpenLCB Send Can (sic) Frame' tool's Event ID (8 bytes): field and then click on [Send Event Produced] nothing happens. The field apparently only accepts space delimited entries. (e.g. 02 01 57 10 00 08 01 A8) This short coming makes it counterintuitive about how to use the tool.Dick :)

PR #5384 https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/5384  has a first cut at that. It’s configured from java/src/apps/TrainCrew/InstallFromURL.properties to make it easy to adjust.  As a starting point, it’ll read from https://github.com/ekapus/TrainCrew/archive/master.zip  and write to web/TrainCrew.

Do the sounds work from a web browser using the redirect?As to making it easier for users: the best approach might be to make it easy for people to install an up-to-date version of the TrainCrew app into their JMRI installed version.  That lets updates to the two parts stay asynchronous.  If Mr. Kapuscinski will maintain e.g. a downloadable .zip file, it's easy.  We can add an “Install or update TrainCrew” menu item to download and unpack.   (See i.e. http://www.codejava.net/java-se/file-io/programmatically-extract-a-zip-file-using-java but there are lots of other tutorials on doing this)  Happy to do that coding if somebody else will help test and document it.Or we could install it directly from GitHub:  https://github.com/ekapus/TrainCrew/archive/master.zip    That’s the current master branch, so it might always be the right one for a general user, which is why a blessed .zip file is better.Bob> On May 26, 2018, at 9:07 AM, Mark Underwood <msunderwd@...> wrote:> > OK, further "debug" / testing.> > I tried simply copying the TrainCrew directory tree into the web/ folder of a copy of JMRI on my computer.

Hard to say about the sound. Might be that there’s some JavaScript that’s looking for sound file URLs that aren’t being redirected.

Question:Does the JMRI web server have the ability to serve/redirect/whatever athird party site?There's a cool app I just found called TrainCrew (http://traincrew.conrail1285.com) that provides a simple interface tosimulate crew ops like handbrake sets, air brake charging, and otherthings, with sound effects.  I thought it would be handy when usingWiThrottle to be able to access it as one of the JMRI web pages... whichwould (I assume) require it to be served up by the JMRI Web Server...The source code is available (open source), so I *could* integrate it intoJMRI as a "native" web page, but if the JMRI web server has the ability toredirect(?) the existing hosted version that might be easier, I dunno.Thoughts?- Mark--  Please consider the environment before printing this email, you will save5g of paper, 250mL of water and at least 35gm of CO2

I think I'd feel better with the case of 'convenience' forms converting tothe standard form on entry. The NCE example for the AIU is one of these, itconverts.I'd like to think that 99%+ of the time, they have user names and wouldnever be normally presented with whichever internal form exists. But I knowthat is not near that level and likely never will be. But the upside is anyconversions help to push the belief that user names are the way they shouldgo. It would mean they have to see (whichever form) of system name less andless of the time.-Ken Cameron, Member JMRI Dev Team http://www.jmri.org http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org http://www.cnymod.com http://www.syracusemodelrr.org

With pick lists, combo boxes and the emphasis on user names, multiple system name formats such as CMRI become less of an issue.When manual entry is allowed, appropriate checks have to be in place.  The open question is what action should be taken.  Logix Conditionals notify the user of the bad name.  Layout Editor accepts the name (with the text box in red), creates an orphan icon and generates a NPE.  I am not aware of any process which substitutes the proper system name.  My preference is to reject with notification.Dave Sand> On May 22, 2018, at 9:08 AM, Bob Jacobsen <jacobsen@...> wrote:> > >> On May 21, 2018, at 1:19 PM, Dave Sand <dave@...> wrote:>> >> The current behavior is that the sensor table allows one or the other form, but rejects an attempt to add the alternate format later.

I use the canonical form in my C/MRI panel development to promote consistency and ease of support.I agree with Ken, a C/MRI node with more than 999 devices of a particular type would be very unique.  The 999 limit is not really an impediment as the node count can be large.  Depending upon the RS-422/485 driver chips used, 32 or 255 is the maximum number of network loads (nodes) which can be supported.In a new client's panel, one which he was doing the table entries, were duplicate un-detected node zero sensor entries.  They appeared to be allowed when not filling out the full bit number with leading zeros.  Subsequent panel loads would throw an error and stop the load process.  Forcing the bit numbers to be three digits was the work around.I planned to include in the next round of C/MRI documentation, some tips on forming system and user names which follow my field use and experience.  In my CMRI/JMRI clinic for NMRA KC I will be using these concepts.  All of the table examples in the clinic slides use the CTnnBBB/CSnnBBB format.If we want to have a consistent canonical form be the result of valid shorthand data entries, I would vote to have the bit number be leading zero filled, at least in the C/MRI case.  I'm not sure how this would affect managers which deal with DCC accessory addresses.Chuck CataniaMRCSOn May 22, 2018, at 7:08 AM, Bob Jacobsen wrote:> >> On May 21, 2018, at 1:19 PM, Dave Sand <dave@...> wrote:>> >> The current behavior is that the sensor table allows one or the other form, but rejects an attempt to add the alternate format later.

The place to start is the JavaDoc: http://www.jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/AbstractMRTrafficController.htmlThat gives you links to the classes that use it, and shows the abstract methods you’re supposed to implement. I think http://www.jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/easydcc/EasyDccTrafficController.html  might be the simplest case, although it doesn’t poll for anything. Perhaps that’s too simple?The http://www.jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/nce/NceTrafficController.html polls, but it’s got some complicated logic in it to decide whether to poll the AIU or have them send unsolicited messages. If the issue is where messages go when received, then consider how simply you can implement these methods:abstract protected void forwardMessage(AbstractMRListener client, AbstractMRMessage m) - just forward it, nothing elseabstract protected void forwardReply(AbstractMRListener client, AbstractMRReply m); - handles reply to a sent message (not a poll reply_abstract protected AbstractMRListener pollReplyHandler()  - handles the reply to a poll, not a sent message.They should be _really_ simple.Bob> On May 21, 2018, at 11:45 AM, Jan Boen <jan.boen@...> wrote:> > Hi Bob,> > > The code is indeed on the JMRI master branch.> > Kevin Dickerson created the original Tams code and I enhanced it.> > The main TamsTrafficController message logic was done by Kevin and I mainly enhanced the message decoding and implemented sending of binary messages to greatly enhance the performance.> > I didn't, still don't to certain degree, really understand what the generic AbstractMRTrafficController could do so I started adding logic in the TamsTrafficController to most probably do what the AbstractMRTrafficController does off the shelf.> > So I'm looking for a basic example to correctly use the AbstractMRTrafficController code to send/receive messages in a synchronous way.> > With that I hope to be able to rework the TamsTrafficController so it does what it needs to do.> > The sending of messages works.> > Alas when e.g. receiving Sensor poll replies these also get forwarded to e.g. the TamsPowerManager etc.> > > I'm pretty sure things can be much simpler and better if done correctly.> > > Thanks,> > > > Jan> > > Op 21/05/18 om 20:35 schreef jmri-developers-request@...:>> Send Jmri-developers mailing list submissions to>> 	jmri-developers@...>> >> To subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit>> 	https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jmri-developers>> or, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to>> 	jmri-developers-request@...>> >> You can reach the person managing the list at>> 	jmri-developers-owner@...>> >> When replying, please edit your Subject line so it is more specific>> than "Re: Contents of Jmri-developers digest...">> >> >> Today's Topics:>> >>    1.

Egbert,That was CMRI about the 'more than 999 pins' on a node had to use the 'B'format. Otherwise how could you tell that LS21456 mean pint 1456 on board 2vs ping 456 on board 21. Only the option for LS2B1456 would make it clear.But I have no clue what the system would retain for this! But that wouldrequire a whole bunch of DOUT or DIN cards on one poor little USIC node.

Some of this is documented in the "Entry Format Summary” table on the Naming documentation page http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/Names.shtmlincluding modification from the entered format to a (common) stored format. If changes are implemented, please also include the results in this cross system table which I synchronised with each of the hardware system help pages.While writing the manager specific entry tool tips I noted that the hardware help pages in some cases suggested entering in a form that is not validated nor stored in the table. I added a few for MERG; the others are described in the table mentioned above.I remember there was one particular system that only allowed nodes over 999 to be entered using something like the “B” entry format, so in that case it seems useful to allow it.Egbert> Op 21 mei 2018, om 21:54 heeft jmri-developers-request@... het volgende geschreven:> > Van: Chuck Catania <cpcrr@... <mailto:cpcrr@...>>> Onderwerp: Antw.: [Jmri-developers] "Smarter" handling of names isn't; can we stop?> Datum: 21 mei 2018 om 21:54:42 CEST> Aan: Discussions between JMRI developers <jmri-developers@... <mailto:jmri-developers@...>>> Bob,> It may depend on the connection hardware requirements.

The alternate forms used in the Conditionals must be old.The current behavior is that the sensor table allows one or the other form, but rejects an attempt to add the alternate format later.  A getSensor returns null if the matching format is not used.  A provideSensor with the alternate format generates a java.lang.IllegalArgumentException argument exception due to a create failure if the primary format exists.  The conditional editor displays a sensor not found message if the wrong format is keyed in.Dave Sand> On May 21, 2018, at 1:43 PM, Bob Jacobsen <jacobsen@...> wrote:> > I’m currently trying sort out some Really Weird Problems due to somebody defining a C/MRI sensor as CS2B23 in the panel file, but then referring to both CS2B23 and CS2023 in Logix Conditionals.

Hi Bob,The code is indeed on the JMRI master branch.Kevin Dickerson created the original Tams code and I enhanced it.The main TamsTrafficController message logic was done by Kevin and I mainly enhanced the message decoding and implemented sending of binary messages to greatly enhance the performance.I didn't, still don't to certain degree, really understand what the generic AbstractMRTrafficController could do so I started adding logic in the TamsTrafficController to most probably do what the AbstractMRTrafficController does off the shelf.So I'm looking for a basic example to correctly use the AbstractMRTrafficController code to send/receive messages in a synchronous way.With that I hope to be able to rework the TamsTrafficController so it does what it needs to do.The sending of messages works.Alas when e.g. receiving Sensor poll replies these also get forwarded to e.g. the TamsPowerManager etc.I'm pretty sure things can be much simpler and better if done correctly.Thanks,JanOp 21/05/18 om 20:35 schreef jmri-developers-request@...:> Send Jmri-developers mailing list submissions to> 	jmri-developers@...>> To subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit> 	https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jmri-developers> or, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to> 	jmri-developers-request@...>> You can reach the person managing the list at> 	jmri-developers-owner@...>> When replying, please edit your Subject line so it is more specific> than "Re: Contents of Jmri-developers digest...">>> Today's Topics:>>     1.

Bob,It may depend on the connection hardware requirements.  The potential impact on existing panels needs to be considered.For new panel work, I enforce two digit C/MRI node addresses and use leading zeros in bit numbers.  For me, this provides a clearer visual name scheme, especially for multiple C/MRI connection environments.  I only use User names in Logix conditionals.  In existing panels where classic node addresses 0,1,2, etc. are present, the User name can mask any system name ambiguity.   For most users with classic C/MRI nodes, single digit node addresses are easier to set in the DIP switches.Chuck CataniaOn May 21, 2018, at 11:43 AM, Bob Jacobsen wrote:> I’m currently trying sort out some Really Weird Problems due to somebody defining a C/MRI sensor as CS2B23 in the panel file, but then referring to both CS2B23 and CS2023 in Logix Conditionals.

Bob,Just to make sure I'm reading right, the one form (usual seen) is node 2,pin 23 input as CS2023. The other form is keeping the form of node 2 and pin23 by using the 'B' in the system name.To my view, we should be doing one of two things when there are multipleways to make up the same physical destination:1. Preserve the form used first by the user, which would then throw an error(duplicate or invalid or something) if the other form was used. Effectivelyforcing a user to pick a form, and then be consistent2. . Another case I'm thinking is NCE code. It has a similar node and pinform for addresses. But there it translated it into the single number form,losing the original form entered by the user. Follow like the NCE sensorsdo, it converts the one form to a single internal representation.It would make it simpler in the xml check if the 'saved' version onlysupported one form. But in the case of #1, how would the xml check know thatit has to enforce a 'one or the other' within the file after (it somehow)figured out which form the user is using? So it sounds like #2 would be moresensible.Now if the conversion to the single form was part of the normalize, the usercould continue to enter whichever fit their fancy at the time, but thesystem would end up with the right answer either way.-Ken Cameron, Member JMRI Dev Team http://www.jmri.org http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org http://www.cnymod.com http://www.syracusemodelrr.org

I’m currently trying sort out some Really Weird Problems due to somebody defining a C/MRI sensor as CS2B23 in the panel file, but then referring to both CS2B23 and CS2023 in Logix Conditionals. (Those two both refer to the same Sensor, i.e. same input pin)I’m not even sure how this can happen with the current code for editing Logix. Perhaps it’s a hold over from earlier code?  There are lots of other places where a Sensor, Turnout or Light can have more than one valid system name, so it’s not just C/MRI.What do we need to ensure works here? Can we force names entered one way into a standard form, or do we have to keep them around as entered? Bob--Bob Jacobsenjacobsen@... +1-510-708-5988 AIM, Skype JacobsenRG

I’m away from hardware until Thursday.  If you could try whatever profiles are straight-forward to test, I’d appreciate it.  Full thread dumps are most useful, as sometimes it takes a bit of digging to see what went wrong.Thanks.Bob> On May 21, 2018, at 11:01 AM, Ken Cameron <kcameron@...> wrote:> > Bob,> > I've got a bunch of different profiles, some don't have LocoNet, I'll try> them.

Bob,I've got a bunch of different profiles, some don't have LocoNet, I'll trythem. I did create a brand new profile which started up fine.Should I setup with non-simulator connections or just try simulators forother vendors than Digitrax? On ones that still hang, do you want dumps fromthem too? Or look at the dump, compare to your 'meaningful' list, and reportones that seem to be hanging somewhere else?-Ken Cameron, Member JMRI Dev Team http://www.jmri.org http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org http://www.cnymod.com http://www.syracusemodelrr.org

As an exercise, I decided to “normalize” the Logix create process.This involves taking the implicit normalization and validation in 6 processes, using 4 system name prefixes, and consolidating them in the Logix manager.  The calling routines are simpler and are subject to a common set of rules.  Any future or third party processes requesting a Logix would automatically use the new process.The only exception is the panel xml file load process has to bypass normalization since existing Logix names cannot be changed.This is the current rule set for Logix system names:    @CheckReturnValue    @Override    public @Nonnull    String normalizeSystemName(@Nonnull String inputName) throws BadSystemNameException {        String sName = inputName.toUpperCase().trim();        if (sName.startsWith("IX") && sName.length() > 2) return sName;        if (sName.startsWith("RTX") && sName.length() > 3) return sName;        if (sName.equals("SYS")) return sName;        if (sName.startsWith("USS CTC")) return sName;        if (sName.equals("IX") || sName.equals("RTX")) {            // name equals prefix            throw new BadSystemNameException();        }        return "IX" + sName;    }I think this approach makes for “smarter” handling of Logix system names.  I don’t think we should undo what has been done so far and revert to adhoc normalization.  That means moving ahead, preferably one bean at a time to keep the scope manageable.Dave Sand

Bob,Sorry for the delay in responding. I was off line over the weekend.I am happy to report that the issue with OPs mode reading tab of our LocoNet based decoders seems to have been corrected.

Bob,Thanks, that fixed it. I thought I was close.The script runs some fast clocks in sync with the computer clock. They hadmechanical parts that were close to the 4:1 but the script does selectivepower interrupting to slow them up a bit to keep together. So off for onefast minute, on for X fast minutes type of thing. After 3 real hours theyare still within 5 minutes of each other. It was kind of a kludge, but youwork with what some people come up with for hardware.-Ken Cameron, Member JMRI Dev Team http://www.jmri.org http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org http://www.cnymod.com http://www.syracusemodelrr.org

Obviously this is a big change, so it may not be the right way to go.Doesn’t really solve the problem, though it can certainly help, because you’ve still got Strings in JTextFields and other GUI elements, as part of serialization, and in calls to scripts, CATS and other code.You can solve all those too with better GUI widgets, smarter serialization, and forcing migration of (i.e. restriction of) the external interfaces to scripts, et al. But that’s a huge amount of work.  And inevitably somebody will say “why bother?” and add String code, and somebody will have to either clean it up in advance or deal with the problems later. The more that’s not migrated, the more likely that is."We" actually tried to do something like that with the NamedBeanHandle class, which provided an earlier form of name-munging for Beans.  The “we” is in quotes because after all the initial enthusiasm a couple of us got left holding the bag on the migration, and after a bit it was noticed that we were actually losing ground:  People were adding old-style code faster than the willing were able to migrate the existing code in their hobby time.  So the effort dried up and  it was just left in place as a good-but-partial solution. That’s why the “do it right” option in my earlier note was phrased in terms of _doing_ it on a branch.  I think it takes a lot of effort to get just a tiny bit of return, but if people are willing to do that, that would be great:  Having it 100% done, even 95% done, would resolve the question.Bob--Bob Jacobsenjacobsen@... +1-510-708-5988 AIM, Skype JacobsenRG

I haven't really delved deeply into the JMRI code in a while, but is therea particular reason that everything is encoded inside of a string?  Itseems like this is the source of a lot of problems.  I'm assuming that thisis more of a historical thing that was added on to since it was alreadyexisting.  Looking at this as (mostly) an outsider, it sounds like it wouldmake more sense to split apart these names into their own object that canthen compare themselves and see what connection they are for and whatnumber they are.  Obviously this is a big change, so it may not be theright way to go.(or I could be missing the concept here completely)-Robert MiddletonOn Tue, May 15, 2018 at 11:57 AM, Dave Sand <dave@...> wrote:> The basic concept of don’t mess with the user supplied names is a good one> with two exceptions.>>    - When a name is being created, it needs to be trimmed to eliminate>    hidden leading and trailing spaces.>    - For user supplied system names, the appropriate two character upper>    case prefix is added if necessary.>> These two cases are handled by the GUI code, along with the normal checks> for duplicates, etc.>> If names are created using third party software, including Python scripts,> they are accepted *as is* with two exceptions.>>    - A system name has to have the appropriate prefix based on the object>    class.

The basic concept of don’t mess with the user supplied names is a good one with two exceptions.When a name is being created, it needs to be trimmed to eliminate hidden leading and trailing spaces.For user supplied system names, the appropriate two character upper case prefix is added if necessary.These two cases are handled by the GUI code, along with the normal checks for duplicates, etc.If names are created using third party software, including Python scripts, they are accepted as is with two exceptions.A system name has to have the appropriate prefix based on the object class.  For example, this means that a provideSensor(‘xyz’) call will return null if xyz is not a sensor user name and cannot be a sensor system name.For creating new objects, the system name, and user name if supplied, have to be unique.The second item does mean that the duplicate checks occur twice for normal GUI actions.System and user names need to be case sensitive.  This ensures uniqueness.  I think a case insensitive search creates complications due to the possibility of multiple results.I think  a couple of other changes are necessary to complete this process.The AbstrackManager#register() method needs to throw a duplicate system name/bean exception.  It does not make sense to register a bean that has already been registered (which can have subtle side effects) and will help identify incomplete upstream code.The other change is to retire the Original Order List concept.  This was the initial cause for issue #5303.  I don’t know the history or the rational for retaining the object order within each class in the panel XML files.  A third bean related list, in addition to _tsys and _beans, adds complexity and risk.Dave Sand

To step back from that would be folly.I understand where you are coming from, but I also understand Bob’s point.I think in the big picture, the current normalization is at least happening in the wrong place.If data read in from a file was previously edited with JMRI, then it should NEVER need normalization, but it is currently normalized, and that is extra work.Data entered by the user could certainly be normalized, but I think that should happen at the user interface, and I think it should be limited to trimming of names.Here is a thought however on how to handle the case of should ‘XYz’ and ‘XYZ’ be the same or different: Let the user decide.  We implement a case sensitive SEARCH and a case insensitive search and call the one the user has requested any time we look for existing objects in the list of NamedBeans.  I believe this should actually work, since we use getXXX and provideXXX to find objects, even in scripts.The case sensitive search off case would be the equivalent of no normalization, so if what I propose doesn’t work for some reason I have not thought about, that is the direction I would lean.Paul

What's visibleand what isn't.Asking someone to distinguish between "XYZ" and "XYZ " is pretty hard.When there isn't any delimiter or other visual indicator of the start andend of the string, it's an exercise in frustration for the user.But "knowing" that when a user types "XYz" that they really meant "XYZ" canbe tough, and I think that's hard to do consistently, and that's the cruxof most of the argument from Bob.  If it's not done uniformly everywhere,it shouldn't be done at all.I'd prefer UI elements that would automatically perform the trimoperation[1], so that the rest of the code doesn't have to worry about it. Then the data is in the correct form, and shouldn't be touched afterthat.   The XML could be considered "good", since the values came from theuser via tools that did the right thing (or from manual editing, which isalways a giant snare).   If things aren't right in the XML, it's a failure,not an opportunity to divine what the user really wanted.1: I don't think as a GUI user for many decades that I have *ever* wanted atrailing space.

Being on the support side of things, I've seen the use of the trim() to havemade users life much better. Since spaces are invisible to the user, theycan't see if they type something wrong. To my life of supporting them, ithas been a great improvement. To step back from that would be folly.>From working with users, I think the improvements that let them ignore thesystem names most of the time has been a great step forward. I recall weeven had some discussion about how to eventually make them go away from thenormal user experience. Long term this may still be a big helping step, butI don't recall we could see a good way to make this work.Now on the case of further formatting, that's something with more wiggleroom. Some systems require specific casing, others do not. But I recallhaving to help users debug their systems often enough where they had endedup with two (or more) objects they had meant to be one, but due to casedifferences, they system had the separate objects. We have to keep in mindthat we are mostly programmers who understand the use of case. Many of ourlanguages use case differences to distinguish different items in our code.This is far from how most users think. They are modelers, not programmers.They want tools to 'just work', and we still come up short in this area.Trying to explain much of this seems to get a glazed over look from manyusers.So from supporting the users view of things, option one is the way we shouldgo.-Ken Cameron, Member JMRI Dev Team http://www.jmri.org http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org http://www.cnymod.com http://www.syracusemodelrr.org

Over the years, people have thought it useful to do things like force some kinds of system names to upper case (so that ISxyz and ISXYZ refer to the same thing), trim leading and trailing spaces from user names, and even to fix curly quotes in names.A lot of work has gone into doing this.I think we should stop.  In fact, I think we should remove the existing attempts, and go back to “the program trusts what you type”.  This note is to discuss that, and see if people want to step up for another solution.Why stop? Because there’s never going to be an end to the effort needed to get even simple forms of this correct, and it’s just not worth it. It’s not worth the people time it’s taking and will take, and it’s not worth the code complexity and brittleness that it’s causing. And, even if we get past all that, we have to make sure that everybody writing code for JMRI includes the right string handling; it’ll never ever end.Why is it so hard to do?  After all, it’s “easy to add trim() in the provideSensor call”.  Well, like most things, just because it’s easy to do some one case in the one place you know about doesn’t mean it’s easy to find all the other places that all the other cases needs to be handled.  Dave Sand and I have been working on current issue (#5303) about this. That’s made it _really_ clear that there are _lots_ of places in the code where we compare strings representing system or user names. And every one of those is a possible place for a problem due to allowing the user to think it’s OK to assume that sloppy entry will be OK.  Either we protect _every_ _one_ of those with normalization code (hard, tedious, slow) or we systematically find every place where a name string can enter the code and normalize there (pretty much impossible, tedious, but not so slow).  Don’t think that happens often in the code?  While listening to a boring graduation speech this afternoon, working on just a phone, I easily found five which I’ve now confirmed with test cases. That sample indicates there are a lot more fish in the pond.Once you start allowing people to try things inconsistently in one place, it’s a terrible user interface to require them to do it consistently somewhere else.  And we get stuck on an never-ending quest to find places where things can come in. Just “go through the GUI and handle (it) there”: Want guess how many places that is? Over a hundred, probably.  Plus scripts can call pretty much anything with user-provided Strings (see the test in #5303). Plus code like CATS that we don’t even know about.We already have about a hundred normalizeSystemName and normalizeUserName calls in the code, plus a bunch more toUpperCase() and trim() operations which never migrated (evidence in itself for how hard it will be for us to organize a solution to this).  That’s extra complexity. Plus extra complexity in the corresponding tests. Given the complexity that’s already there, plus the user cost of inconsistent behavior, it seems to me that as a group we have several options:1) Create a proposal that handles matching _throughout _the code. Document (i.e. on the Names page) how to write future code so that new code remains consistent. Identify the list of places where changes are needed, and find people to do them systematically.Or2) Right after 4.12 is released, take all the normalization out:  4.13 (which we can call 5.0 if it makes people feel better) will use names as entered. Update the documentation. I’d be happy to do the work for this, including fixing any issues that are found by the tests.  If people want to add user friendliness, they can add better user-level interactions to the code in places where things don’t match, e.g. add a “Create new one or re-enter the existing name?” prompt if something doesn’t match via a standard interface widget.  (Exiting panel files will be fine if they were written out with a 4.8-4.12 release; hand-edited files may not be, but can be written out or fixed; scripts that count on i.e. lower-case names -> upper case will have to be updated)We actually tried (1) about 15 months ago. The normalizeSystemName and normalizeUserName calls were put in place, and some migration was done.  But we’re _still_ not done with that (see #5303), despite lots of time spent.  I now think we’re not even half way there.I’d be happy to hand (1) off to others who will commit to get it done.  Some of it is tricky work, because people are tempted to treat the symptoms instead of the cause, and that just results in downstream problems. Most of it is just finding all the places with one of the documented issues and making the fix recommended  in the new documentation.Staying where we are now is not one of the options: We’re paying a price in complexity and we’re not providing a consistent user experience. I’ve got some time for a project like this during a trip in the latter half of June, which is the right timing for (2).  So, in the absence of a successful start on (1) by then, I can do (2) and get it ready for 4.13.1 (or 5.0).Thoughts?Bob--Bob Jacobsenjacobsen@... +1-510-708-5988 AIM, Skype JacobsenRG

I just discovered that the Ops Mode Read issue I was seeing was related tothe specific LONG_ACK response sent by a DCS240 when track power is OFF.Turns out that the DCS240 sends a LONG_ACK failure response to an Ops ModeRead requests when Track Power is OFF.  This is causing JMRI to fail theRead and ignore the subsequent Ops Read response from the Loconet stationarydecoder.  My test bench always had track power ON when running earlier testreleases which is why I never saw this before.There appears to be a similar issue during Loconet Stationary Interrogatewhen JMRI starts if the Turnout Handling option is set to Normal.  WithTrack Power OFF, the DCS240 sends a LONG_ACK failure response to everyLoconet Stationary Interrogate message (Switch Request) from JMRI.  Eventhough all the Loconet Stationary decoders respond properly right afterthat, the LONG_ACK failure response causes JMRI to keep retrying theStationary Interrogate message.So it appears that tweaking the LONG_ACK response handling in JMRI for theDCS240 is probably the solution.Regards,Robin-----Original Message-----From: Robin Becker <rbgroups@...> Sent: Monday, May 07, 2018 1:03 PMTo: 'Discussions between JMRI developers'<jmri-developers@...>Subject: RE: [Jmri-developers] Change to LocoNet OPs Mode ReadDick,Hi!

Unplugging and plugging devices while theoperating system is up and running will be configured on a first come first serve basis. Byconfiguring JMRI to use the devices the os finds at boot time you can eliminate the problemfor the most part.During hardware development this option is not always available so using virtual ports is abetter option with the added advantage of spying on traffic.On 02/05/18 01:05, Kai Vehmersalo wrote:> I have had problems with the JMRI when using USB ports.>> After many problems as the computer (Windows or Ubuntu)> seems to pick new USB ports as a lottery the result has> been that JMRI is dropping off turnouts and some other> required items at new starts.>> I have moved to Ethernet connection (I do not know if> Tams is supporting Ethernet) as it is reliable if you> do remember to start the Ethernet first in your network.>> ESU ECoS and JMRI and MERG support Ethernet connections.> With Ethernet you may have 4 concurrent connections.>> I think it is a bug in the JMRI if it really drops out> items you have been using earlier.

Now I find that Ops Mode Read commands are issued butthe response is not handling correctly so things are broken again.  I openedissue 5300 on this.FYI there is a separate thing I ran into where the "Read Changes on Sheet"and "Read Sheet" buttons come up disabled but the "Read Changes on AllSheets" and "Read All Sheets" buttons come up enabled.  Not sure everyonesees this but it happens consistently on my system.  Clicking the "ReadChanges on All Sheets" button once "fixes" this.  I opened issue 5523 onthis one.

Chuck,It sounds to me like you've been bitten by the problem where Netbeans wantsto do what it wants to do, not what we want it to do.  Netbeans has beenknown to IGNORE the "three-sided" development methodology which is preferredby leading JMRI developers.  It might even change the git configuration - ithas been so long since I stopped fiddling with Netbeans GIT functionality, Idon't remember!In my work with JMRI, I have found it easiest to do my development work inNetbeans, but do anything related to git via a command-line git operation.That way, Netbeans CANNOT mess with my git configuration!I STRONGLY recommend that you STOP using Netbeans "git integration", untilthe point when a Netbeans-literate, Git-literate developer can figure outhow to prevent Netbeans from being stupid, and communicate the requiredtweaks to those of us who are Netbeans-based developers.Do you have git support on the command line?  If not, you should get itconfigured.  What operating system do you run?I STRONGLY recommend that you re-configure your local git repository for the"three-cornered" development methodology recommended for JMRI development.Specifically, use "git command-line" tools to ensure that the "git remote-v" command returns something like:origin  https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI.git (fetch)origin  https://github.com/CCatania01/JMRI.git (push)Specifically note that the "push" operations by default will go to -your-remote repository on Github, while the "fetch" (or "pull") operations willby default come from the main JMRI repository on Github.When I use a git command from the command line to "push" my local git branchto -my- remote repository (https://devel-bobm/JMRI ), the command-line gitimplementation will recognize that -my- remote repository doesn't have abranch by that name and will automatically create the branch in -my- remoterepository.  Then I can log into Git via a web browser, and, from -my-repository, make a "pull request" to the JMRI repository.Regards,Bob M.> -----Original Message-----> From: Chuck Catania [mailto:cpcrr@...]> Sent: Wednesday, May 02, 2018 12:40 PM> To: Jmri-developers@...> Subject: Re: [Jmri-developers] Push Upstream Error> > When doing the Push to Upstream, the first dialog presented indicates thatthe> push is about to create a new branch (mrcs-dev2) in the remote repository.The> repository listing from NetBeans shows that branch does not exist in the> remote.> > Chuck Catania

You can see our notional release schedule in the usual place: https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=openLeading up to JMRI 4.12, the current notional sequence is:*) 4.11.6 roughly May 12, 2018 - usual release from master HEAD*) 4.11.7 roughly June 1, 2018 - from master HEAD, this is the last “take everything” release before 4.12.  Note that this is earlier in the month than our usual “2nd full weekend”.*) 4.11.8 roughly June 16, 2018 - Only selected and necessary changes to bring the 4.11 series up to a production 4.12 release e.g. last minute decoder changes, specific fixes to _new_ bugs, etc.(Additional bug update test releases as needed)*) 4.12 July 8, 2018 - production release*) 4.13.1 July 9, 2018 - test release from master HEAD with all PRs since 4.11.7Two key take-aways from this:*) If you have a big project, please get it done and PR’d this month (May) if you want it in 4.12.  If not, no problem, it’ll be in the next series and be available to users in 4.13.1 at about the same time.*) Since people will be paying attention to these deadlines, if you anticipate wanting to push them back, please speak up soon.Bob--Bob Jacobsenjacobsen@... +1-510-708-5988 AIM, Skype JacobsenRG

I have had problems with the JMRI when using USB ports.After many problems as the computer (Windows or Ubuntu)seems to pick new USB ports as a lottery the result hasbeen that JMRI is dropping off turnouts and some otherrequired items at new starts.I have moved to Ethernet connection (I do not know ifTams is supporting Ethernet) as it is reliable if youdo remember to start the Ethernet first in your network.ESU ECoS and JMRI and MERG support Ethernet connections.With Ethernet you may have 4 concurrent connections.I think it is a bug in the JMRI if it really drops outitems you have been using earlier. I do not check thatany more as I am using only Ethernet connection to JMRI.Kai "Waiski" Vehmersalo, Finland###On 18.03.2018 18:54, Jan Boen wrote:> Hi,>> Not sure if this problem has already been flagged or already been > resolved.> On a couple of older Ubuntu machines (running 32-bit versions) we have > a problem when combining the Tams MasterControl with JMRI 4.10.> All looks fine but JMRI simply doesn't communicate with the command > station even after after updating the preferences.> Just use JMRI 4.8 and all works just fine.> Any suggestions?> As I'm writing this I will check if it is also related to the local > settings (Dutch vs English).> On Windows this is not a problem at all.>> Thanks,>> Jan>> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ >> Check out the vibrant tech community on one of the world's most> engaging tech sites, Slashdot.org! http://sdm.link/slashdot> _______________________________________________> Jmri-developers mailing list> Jmri-developers@...> https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jmri-developers>

Hi Jan,There's some good JMRI Git info here: http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/html/doc/Technical/GitFAQ.shtmlMany (most?) of the JMRI devs will tell you to use the command line git, soif you heed that, you can stop reading here. :)I access git inside of Eclipse, using the same three-way repo setup shown.Team, Git, Pull and Team, Git, Push both have ".." versions which allow meto setup and verify that I'm going in the right direction.Push goes to my repo: https://github.com/mstevetodd/JMRI and Pull comesfrom the JMRI repo: https://github.com/JMRI/JMRIEclipse will remember your choices for subsequent pull/pushes.When I created my "remotes" (the URLs listed above), I gave them meaningful(to me) names, as I found "origin" unhelpful. My remote names are "JMRI"and "mstevetodd".So, to recap, I pull from JMRI regularly. If I make a change, I commitlocally, then push to mstevetodd. Then I create a PR from mstevetodd toJMRI using github.If you have more questions about using Eclipse with JMRI, feel free toemail me directly and I'll do my best to help.Regards,  SteveTOn Tue, May 1, 2018 at 5:51 AM, Jan Boen <jan.boen@...> wrote:> Hi all,>> Sorry to be bothering with an ignorance question...> I have installed a new hard drive and am now getting my JMRI/GIT> development set-up working again.> I installed a fresh copy of Eclipse and have gotten the latest JMRI master> code into it.> How do I now make sure that what I do ends up in my JMRI fork instead of> directly going to the master when I do a pull?>> Thanks,>>> Jan>> ---> Dit e-mailbericht is gecontroleerd op virussen met Avast antivirussoftware.> https://www.avast.com/antivirus>>> ------------------------------------------------------------> ------------------> Check out the vibrant tech community on one of the world's most> engaging tech sites, Slashdot.org! http://sdm.link/slashdot> _______________________________________________> Jmri-developers mailing list> Jmri-developers@...> https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jmri-developers>

See also https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/5164#issuecomment-376535891it would be really useful to have step-by-step instructions for getting a heap dump file and a thread dump file from PanelPro while it’s running.Can I interest anybody in spending a bit of time doing that?Bob--Bob Jacobsenjacobsen@... +1-510-708-5988 AIM, Skype JacobsenRG

Hi all,So far we/I have successfully used JMRI with Tams MasterControl, DCC controlled turnouts and signals, Logix and internal sensors.We now have an S88 module with 16 switches connected with JMRI 4.10, Tams MasterControl, DCC controlled devices, Logix, internal and external sensors.As long as we don't enable the Logix which work in conjunction with the external sensors everything works just fine.Toggle switches = see status changes in Tams sensors under TablesControl turnouts and signals = things happen on the layoutPower control works etc.In command monitor you see the commands being sent and the polling taking place for checking status changes (power, dcc turnouts, sensors).The moment we activate 1 single Logix that uses S88 connected switches things go wrong.An endless stream of turnout commands is being sent to which the Tams MC duly replies.As this stream of commands never stops the polling also stops.The sensors end up in bogus states which makes the turnout unreliable as well.When using Tams simulator mode this doesn't (seem) to happen.What are we missing?Thanks,---Dit e-mailbericht is gecontroleerd op virussen met Avast antivirussoftware.https://www.avast.com/antivirus

Not to sound stupid, but if this generated so much discussion on what to do, why not make it a preference option.

Doing that in JMRI would be faster. It ?risks somebody selecting an inappropriate font? (quote is from the long bikeshedding conversation earlier about the feature).It seems to me that somebody who selects Noto Sans CJK JP Regular and doesn?t like how it looks can just select something else.The earlier discussion of this feature ended up with lots of people arguing about how other people ?should? use the program.

I can not imagine why JMRI needs to know the font metrics of Noto Sans CJK JP Regular, UnBatang, KacstFarsi, or any number of the 100's of other fonts that lurk on my system, much less to recalculate all that information every time the program gets started up.>> Word processing programs seem to get along just fine by selecting their fonts on an as needed basis. That a model railroad control program has any legitimate need to do all this font pre-processing seems really, really, strange. I feel pretty sure that if the developer that added this had more than a few fonts available on his system, it never would have happened in the first place, because he would have seen the huge negative impact that it can have on JMRI performance for some users. Sorry, but yes, I do consider a 50% reduction in my processor availability for 5-6 minutes after JMRI is started to be a "huge negative" impact.>> Dick :)>>> On 04/28/2018 12:00 AM, Bob Jacobsen wrote:>> Thanks.

The actual current status is that  http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/util/swing/FontComboUtil.html class (which is where all this happens) defines four font type symbols: CHARACTER, MONOSPACED, PROPORTIONAL, SYMBOL (plus ALL). ALL fonts are divided into SYMBOL and CHARACTER; CHARACTER is further divided into MONOSPACED and PROPORTIONAL.In JMRI’s Java source code (e.g. not counting any uses that be in tests, scripts, CATS, etc), the uses are:ALL:	PrintOptionPanelCHARACTER: (None)MONOSPACED:	PrintOptionPanel	SystemConsoleConfigPanel	SystemConsolePreferencesManagerPROPORTIONAL: (none)SYMBOL: (None)So there are three places that want to present just the fonts that are found to be monospaced:From java/src/jmri/jmrit/operations/setup/PrintOptionPanel.java:    private void loadFontComboBox() {        fontComboBox.removeAllItems();        List<String> fonts = FontComboUtil.getFonts(FontComboUtil.ALL);        if (tabFormatCheckBox.isSelected() || !manifestFormatComboBox.getSelectedItem().equals(Setup.STANDARD_FORMAT)) {            fonts = FontComboUtil.getFonts(FontComboUtil.MONOSPACED);        }        for (String font : fonts) {            fontComboBox.addItem(font);        }        fontComboBox.setSelectedItem(Setup.getFontName());    }That method is private, hence is only used in PrintOptionPanel; it appears to be part of the print setup.From java/src/apps/SystemConsoleConfigPanel.java:    private static final JComboBox<String> fontFamily = FontComboUtil.getFontCombo(FontComboUtil.MONOSPACED, 14);I believe this requires the font combobox to be created when the class is first referenced for loading or storing the Console in the Preferences, but I haven’t traced that in detail.From java/src/apps/systemconsole/SystemConsolePreferencesManager.java    public void setFontFamily(String fontFamily) {        if (FontComboUtil.isReady()) {            if (FontComboUtil.getFonts(FontComboUtil.MONOSPACED).contains(fontFamily)) {                String oldFontFamily = this.fontFamily;                this.fontFamily = fontFamily;                this.firePropertyChange(FONT_FAMILY, oldFontFamily, fontFamily);                SystemConsole.getInstance().setFontFamily(this.getFontFamily());            } else {                log.warn("Incompatible console font \"{}\" - using \"{}\"", fontFamily, this.getFontFamily());            }        } else {            ThreadingUtil.runOnGUIDelayed(() -> {                this.setFontFamily(fontFamily);            }, 1000); // one second        }    }This is referenced from SystemConsoleConfigPanelXml (for persisting the console configuration), SystemConsoleConfigPanel (configuration GUI) and SystemConsolePreferencesManager.Bob--Bob Jacobsenjacobsen@... +1-510-708-5988 AIM, Skype JacobsenRG

I agree on the negative impact. The purpose is to be able to provide lists of e.g. monospaced fonts, which in turn becomes s selector box for those. Many programs provide lists of all fonts, and only when you select them do they retrieve the characteristics. Doing that in JMRI would be faster. It “risks somebody selecting an inappropriate font” (quote is from the long bikeshedding conversation earlier about the feature). It seems to me that somebody who selects Noto Sans CJK JP Regular and doesn’t like how it looks can just select something else.

Bob,There is disk activity, but only short winks and blinks. If the disk activity itself was responsible for the slow down, then I would expect the activity light to be on a lot more.Is all this pre-fetched information actually used at some point, or would it work just as well to only get the specific metrics required when a font is actually selected for use? I can not imagine why JMRI needs to know the font metrics of Noto Sans CJK JP Regular, UnBatang, KacstFarsi, or any number of the 100's of other fonts that lurk on my system, much less to recalculate all that information every time the program gets started up.Word processing programs seem to get along just fine by selecting their fonts on an as needed basis. That a model railroad control program has any legitimate need to do all this font pre-processing seems really, really, strange. I feel pretty sure that if the developer that added this had more than a few fonts available on his system, it never would have happened in the first place, because he would have seen the huge negative impact that it can have on JMRI performance for some users.

Thanks.  If those samples are representative (no reason to believe they’re not, but just in case) then that huge chunk of time really is in java.awt.Component.getFontMetrics(), the method we’re calling repeatedly to get information on each font.  AFAIK, there’s not much we can do to speed that up from JMRI other than to not call it. (Don’t know if there’s anything that can be done outside JMRI to pre-index fonts or anything like that)Not sure why you’re not seeing the disk light working.  There are calls to java.nio methods from the PrepareFontLists thread in those snapshots, so somebody is requesting I/O (probably getFontMetrics() but I can’t say that for sure).  Maybe that info is somehow already cached somewhere?  That would be consistent with the font thread running (close to) 100% of one core on your machine, i.e. not waiting for anything.Bob> On Apr 26, 2018, at 7:31 PM, Dick Bronson <dick@...> wrote:> > Bob,> Hopefully this is what you need.

Andrew,Not sure if it is only related to 'stealing' a loco - it seems related to a cab session ending (although that happens when a session is stolen).A dialogue pops up when a session-end message arrives in JMRI saying that the session is no longer active.The 'release' button' is still active, but IIRC clicking it simply changes the state of the button - I don't think it sends any more messages,so it might be just a UI issue...Dave

Daniel,Thanks for the suggestion.  Just changing the TEMP variable from the command line did not help.  Seems out logout/login is required for the Temp location to actually change.  Changed TEMP via advanced System settings so it would persist across login and then I was able to install.  The install took really long time though, as the TEMP location was now on the FlashDisk.  (The only choices for TEMP location on this box are RamDisk and FlashDisk. ). It would have been faster to change the RamDisk size, reboot, install, change the RamDisk size back...So I do have 2 options that work.  Could live with this, but still wonder if there is something better?  In the meantime  I plan to increase the Ram to 4Gb.  If that works, I'll just permanently increase the RamDisk size.RobinOn Tue, Apr 24, 2018 at 1:33 PM -0700, <db123@...> wrote:One thing you could try is to change the temp folder.

Final ImplementationZero length is defined as the turnout circle radius.  This is used by the drag/drop automatic segment creation.  This value is the constant SIZE, value of 3, times the selected turnout circle size which defaults to 4, resulting in a radius of 12.  Dropping a turnout point within one grid width of the target results in the automatic segment.  Changing the circle size to 3 requires that the dropped turnout point has to be closer than 9.The automatic track segment gets the block from the stationary turnout.Changes to turnout blocks result in updating each connected track segment if the the track segment length is less than the turnout circle radius.  This occurs regardless of what the track segment is connected to on the other end.Dave Sand> On Apr 21, 2018, at 12:28 PM, George Warner <geowar1@...> wrote:> > On Fri, 20 Apr 2018 15:51:55 -0500, Dave Sand <dave@...> wrote:>> Along those same lines:  If the block assignment for A or B is changed (including removed), the new value is propagated to the zero length track segment if there is one.>> What has not been discussed is the definition of zero length.

Ken,That covers the case where the two turnouts have different blocks.What I am looking at fixing is the case where the two turnouts have the same block and the resulting “gap” which breaks the contiguous track component requirement for blocks. New rules:If neither turnout has a block, the connecting segment does not have a block.If either turnout has a block, use that block for the connecting segment.If both turnouts have blocks that are different, pick one.If both turnouts have the same block, use that block for the connecting segment.The rules would be applied when the connecting track segment is automatically created or when the block assignment for either turnout is changed.

When creating a track plan, it is possible to connect turnouts together by dragging one so that the connection points overlap.  This automatically creates the required track segment between the turnouts.  The track segment has a zero length and is effectively invisible unless one of the turnouts is moved to expose the track segment.Since this track segment is not visible, it is frequently missed when assigning blocks.  This results in unpredictable behavior for features that rely on block connectivity. Which then result in numerous support questions.The fix that I plan to create is that when two *turnouts* with the same block are connected by a track segment without a block assignment or a different block, the track segment is changed to use the turnout block.*turnout* includes cross-overs, slips and level crossings.Any feedback?Dave Sand

Thanks for the CPU plot.  The lack of disk activity makes this appear to be Yet Another Problem, separate from the Windows “load font so you can check it” problem.  When you get time, could you send me a couple of snapshots taken during that high-CPU phase?  To do that, open jvisualvm and target JMRI’s running Java process.  Select “Sampler”, then click “CPU”.You get “Sampling in progress” followed by some “hot spots” which will update occasionally. That might point to were all the CPU time is going,but if there’s nothing obvious there, click “Snapshot” (which changes the screen layout) and then the odd “export to” icon:That lets you store the snapshot into a file (by convention, with a .nps extension).  Two or three of these might make it possible to track this down a bit.  Not sure I can fix it, of course, because what we’ve got there is now quite complex.  In that case, the right solution (which I favor anyway) is to go back to the nice clean code that Matt Harris originally wrote.Bob> On Apr 20, 2018, at 5:28 AM, Dick Bronson <dick@...> wrote:> > Bob,> OK, running JMRI.4.11.6ish+jenkins+20180419T2149Z+Raca91d7.tgz> > It still hogs resources like they were free for 5-6 minutes, (see attached) but it no longer blocks the opening of the Preferences window.

There is fix to make this quite a bit better. Bob J did some coding so veryfew parts of JMRI will care about this font processing. Normal startup,preferences, and tables don't delay waiting for this. The core problem ofwhy it takes so long with certain fonts still exists, but only if somethingneeded those fonts as I understand it.This has been merged and will be part of 4.11.6 and is part of the dailybuilds now. It was impacting a lot of Windows systems too, but only when youhad other software loaded that installed lots of fonts. So if you had acomputer that only was (ever) used with simple things like JMRI, it wouldn'tbe noticeable. But if it had big packages of software like the Office suitesor Adobe larger products, you had a long wait.-Ken Cameron, Member JMRI Dev Team http://www.jmri.org http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org http://www.cnymod.com http://www.syracusemodelrr.org

That’s the same problem with pre-loading all the fonts.  The “PrepareFontListsThread” thread is running. Meanwhile, 147 “FontComboUtil Prepare” threads are blocked. (It would be interesting to know where those all come from; are you opening a bunch of windows at the start?) The “init prefs” thread is blocked in jmri.util.swing.FontComboUtil.prepareFontLists(..) That’s all tangled up in this wait:"TabbedPreferencesAction actionPerformed" #74 prio=6 os_prio=0tid=0x0000000022ea2800 nid=0xe4 waiting for monitor entry[0x000000002817e000]  java.lang.Thread.State: BLOCKED (on object monitor)       at apps.gui3.TabbedPreferences.init(TabbedPreferences.java:138)       - waiting to lock <0x0000000082c3e928> (aapps.gui3.TabbedPreferences)       atapps.gui3.TabbedPreferencesAction.lambda$0(TabbedPreferencesAction.java:87)       atapps.gui3.TabbedPreferencesAction$$Lambda$133/386599598.run(Unknown Source)       at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)The real problem here is that we’re trying to be smarter than Java by creating a bunch of pre-loaded status information for fonts.  That’s not a supported operation in the JVM.  Java gives you fast access to the names of fonts, but as we’ve learned access to the property set of a font can be slow, and there can be a lot of fonts.So we have two choices:1) Either get serious about it, and create caching utilities that work across all the various OS, font type, etc combinations2) Or just stop trying to do it.Personally, if this was my problem to solve, I’d go with (2).Bob> On Apr 15, 2018, at 10:47 AM, Ken Cameron <kcameron@...> wrote:> > Bob,> > Here is one from the 4.11.5.

Matt,Thanks.  Bob mentioned the long strings but I didn't get the part aboutgoing to "Special Builds" on nsis.sourceforge.net.  I downloaded the largestrings built, copied the files over the existing ones in ProgramFiles(x86)/NSIS, then rebuilt launchjmri.exe.   The new launchjmri.exesuccessfully brings up jmri on my test box, although it still doesn't matchthe .exe on jmri master so it shows up as a change in the Github app.   Thisis NSIS 3.03 so maybe that is the reason?

We've lately had the same problem with Mac. That's one of the reasons that the ant build of LaunchJMRI.exe is no longer required in the ant package-windows target.Unfortunately, with the Mac we can run package-windows (once a new NSIS version is installed) but the resulting JMRI installer hangs when it gets to the Select Options screens. We haven't resolved that one and it is quite an inconvenience to me as I build on Mac and sometimes want to test on a Windows VM.Sent from my iPad-- Dave> On 12 Apr 2018, at 3:03 AM, Robin Becker <rbgroups@...> wrote:> > Hi.

Can that new version of the FREDI use a bit to control “address valid” or not instead of a magic value?  In that case, your choice (2) seems much better.  Although I understand that legacy equipment can make them necessary, magic values like 0xFFFF, 0x3FFF, or -1 always seem a bit forced and confusing to me.Bob> On Apr 8, 2018, at 1:34 AM, Martin Pischky <martin@...> wrote:> > Hello Bob, Hello *,> > Thanks to all for your suggestions and help.> > Am 07.04.2018 um 18:09 schrieb Bob Jacobsen:>> Knut, there’s something here I don’t understand.

The FRED throttle can have two different states. Either it has a loco address or it doesn't. The FRED itself has no way to enter an address so it gets the loco address by dispatching from the LocoNet central. What I mean is that is that another throttle needs to dispatch the loco address to the FRED.Under some circumstances the FRED may lose its loco address, for example if some other controller is using that address or if the user decides to undispatch the loco address.RegardsDaniel2018-04-07 18:09 skrev Bob Jacobsen:> I think the email below is where the “can CVs be signed” subthread> started.

Alain,Right now, SourceForge is the right place for discussions.On groups.io I'm keeping an archive of recent conversations fromSourceForge in preparation for a potential future move and to ensure thatthe message archive is complete.

I think the email below is where the “can CVs be signed” subthread started. Instead of getting diverted by that, I think we should stick with the actual issue presented.Knut, there’s something here I don’t understand.  It sounds like you want to, under some circumstances, put the value 65535 into a DCC long address field. Since that’s not possible  (the NMRA definition for long address doesn’t have space for that value), I must be misunderstanding something.  What does that value do?  In what sense are CV 8 and 9 a “DCC long address”?Also, that masks in that element define a 14-bit field that doesn’t include the MSB in CV 8 and 9.  That doesn’t allow a value as big as 65535.  Is this just an mistake, or is there some need to reserve those two bits for another purpose?Thanks and sorry for the confusion.Bob> On Apr 6, 2018, at 11:50 AM, Knut Schwichtenberg <kschwi@...> wrote:> > Hello,> > I'm trying to improve FREDi XML file.

Thanks for trying that. “Negative” CV values aren’t something that’s come up, so there are no JUnit tests in place, so various systems probably don’t handle them.I agree there are are lots of other things to work on. As to whether it should get any attention, was the original question just speculation, or is there some specific need?Bob> On Apr 7, 2018, at 2:34 AM, Dave Heap <dgheap@...> wrote:> > Just tried entering -1 in a CV value on the CVs pane.> > Any negative value causes the write to be transmuted into a Read Command in the NCE Simulator, but the displayed value in the pane doesn't change and instead a 301 No Loco Detected is returned, despite the simulator returning a 7B 21 (value 123 was read successfully).> > Doing the same on another pane (where there is a decVal with implicit 0-255 range) is displayed as the unsigned equivalent (-1 =>255, -10=>246) after entry is done and the correct unsigned value equivalent is written.> > All is not well on the CVs pane...

Just tried entering -1 in a CV value on the CVs pane.Any negative value causes the write to be transmuted into a Read Command in the NCE Simulator, but the displayed value in the pane doesn't change and instead a 301 No Loco Detected is returned, despite the simulator returning a 7B 21 (value 123 was read successfully).Doing the same on another pane (where there is a decVal with implicit 0-255 range) is displayed as the unsigned equivalent (-1 =>255, -10=>246) after entry is done and the correct unsigned value equivalent is written.All is not well on the CVs pane...

Since a single CV (as in decVal) is only 8 bits  and two CVs (as in splitVal) are only 16 bits but all are stored in int variables (32 bits) the range comparisons are de-facto unsigned as no high bit extension is done. But there's no way Knut can get 0 to 65353 with the bit masks he has that limit the stored value to 14 bits (0 to 16383).Sent from my iPad-- Dave > On 7 Apr 2018, at 6:39 AM, Ken Cameron <kcameron@...> wrote:> > Would you say the correct answer is the CV's are unsigned numbers?

By default, the ‘min’ attribute is zero. You can set it negative in decimal formatted (DecVal) variables and it should work as an entry field, slider, etc. it still becomes “just bits” when written to the device, so the device has to handle it properly.

Variables are generally unsigned in JMRI so min="0" max="65535" in the splitVal element would be correct EXCEPT that your mask="XVVVVVVV" and upperMask="XVVVVVVV" limit your maximum value to 14 bits (range 0 to 16383)Sent from my iPad-- DaveThe New England Convention 2018http://www.newenglandmodelrailwayclub.com/content/convention.shtml> On 7 Apr 2018, at 4:50 AM, Knut Schwichtenberg <kschwi@...> wrote:> > I'm trying to improve FREDi XML file.

Hello,I'm trying to improve FREDi XML file. My problem is the value range forthe DCC address. DCC addresses are valid in the range from 0 to 10239.To define the undispatched in FREDi status, the address value of 65535(0xffff) is defined. Currently "Public_Domain_FREDi_LNSV2.xml" isimplement as below.....<variable CV="9" item="Advanced Group 1 Option 6"                      readOnly="no" mask="XVVVVVVV"                      comment="Loco address">                <splitVal highCV="8" upperMask="XVVVVVVV" /></variable>...Currently "min" and "max" are missing, which only extends the addressrange. How can I define the value of 0xffff (-1) as valid within theJMRI dialogue?Cheers,Knut

I desperately want to get it finished but life keeps getting in the way.It is backward compatible with the existing 2 CV splitVal, including masks, scaling and offsets for the 2 CV case.It may not be too difficult for me to allow the degenerate case of 1 CV with scaling and offset.Dave

Hi KenWhen consisting more than 2 addresses together using certain firmware versionsof the DT402 the throttle sets the status to common of the loco that was on thethrottle you used to add the the third and subsequent locos.Or another way to try and explain it, if you have loco #2 on the left #3 on theright, MU + so the left is now "CN" and the right "TOP"Now as soon as you hit the "LOCO" button to change the left throttle to say #4the DT402 sets the #3 to "COMMON".Now if you "Universal Consist" using JMRI, which I discovered this morning Icouldn't do, it only let me do "Advanced", that shouldn't happen.And since the weather has closed in again so I cant enjoy being outside, I mightlook at that today.Steve Gigiel> ---------- Original Message ----------> From: Ken Cameron <kcameron@...>> Date: March 28, 2018 at 11:34 PM> > > I should add the other system is still running 4.11.2 and same odd behavior> of the slot monitor.

Has anyone used it lately? It seems to not display anything others thanactive slots, unless you enable 'show all slots'. I was suspect, so I saidshow all slots. It showed me a few slots with speeds in them, so those wouldseem active to me. I then saw odd behavior where it would show one slot, butif I tried to acquire a loco with that number (normal steal), it would showa new slot for that duplicate loco. This was at the club, and I forgot tocheck the console to see if it had issues. But I also saw this at anotherlayout, but didn't get around to mentioning it.Is there something up with the slots? Both systems were DCS200's that havebeen around a while.-Ken Cameron, Member JMRI Dev Team http://www.jmri.org http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org http://www.cnymod.com http://www.syracusemodelrr.org

Related to this, can the XML check offer a warning? I mean it would give amessage that something is 'depreciated' and in the future this would countas a failure. This would be an example of where it could have been handy.Once we knew we were changing the format to use sensible system names, itcould have started warning users, and they could use their existing versionto fix it. A user pretty much did this when we explained what the issue was.He did a rename trick of his JMRI and his old JMRI to run the old versiononce so he could fix the file. Then a rename back and it was working.-Ken Cameron, Member JMRI Dev Team http://www.jmri.org http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org http://www.cnymod.com http://www.syracusemodelrr.org

The Route and Block tables allow numeric system names. Is there any objection if I modify the new object process to add the IR or IB prefix along with upper case if necessary?  This will not fix existing occurrences.Dave Sand

The JMRI Windows installer currently leaves the “classes” directory in place when doing an upgrade.  This is unlike Linux and macOS, which do a complete replacement.  That directory is on the classpath early, so anything there will be taken in preference to what’s in e.g. jmri.jar.This might be a good thing: Somebody has put something there for a reason, and it will continue to do whatever happy thing motivated that.More likely, it’ll cause hard-to-diagnose problems, because the contents are out-of-date with the new JMRI version. This happened over the weekend at a local layout who updated to JMRI 4.10 with old content in classes that looks like it was a patch on a 3.something release.  (There were lots of other problems on that update, though; it hadn’t been done in many years)PR #5113 (https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/5113) updates the Windows installer to remove the classes subdirectory, just like the other installs. I’m not a NSIS expert, but I think that it’s backed up during an earlier part of the install.I don’t have a good way to check this.  Could somebody please pull it, make a Windows installer, and check it? Alternately, I can merge it, wait for Jenkins to build the installer, and then somebody could please try that.Thanks.Bob--Bob Jacobsenjacobsen@... +1-510-708-5988 AIM, Skype JacobsenRG

Hi Jan,You'll need to provide more details. For example:What sort of elements are not displaying properly (text labels, signal masticons, turnouts, other)?This is Panel Editor, not Layout Editor, or Control Panel Editor, correct?Does the web panel show others items updating properly?Does the web panel show the errant items updating properly if changed bysomething other than your logix? For example, directly in the table.It would also be helpful if you could send me your panel and a descriptionof how to duplicate the error.--SteveTOn Sun, Mar 18, 2018 at 1:10 PM, Jan Boen <jan.boen@...> wrote:> Hi,>> Using Logixs I created some automation.> The JMRI Panel Editor screen will always show the correct status but the> web browser (tested Chrome on PC and Safari on iOS) don't reflect all the> changes properly.> Using F5 or similar will show the correct situation.> Any idea what can be wrong?>> Thanks,>>> Jan>> ------------------------------------------------------------> ------------------> Check out the vibrant tech community on one of the world's most> engaging tech sites, Slashdot.org! http://sdm.link/slashdot> _______________________________________________> Jmri-developers mailing list> Jmri-developers@...> https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jmri-developers>

There was some discussion recently about changes that were made to the connection status in DP3. Has any work been done to revert the confusing green "Internal Is Online" message?I have just noticed in 4.11.4 (but may be also earlier releases) that immediately after creating a new SPROG profile the display is as it used to be, and still desired to be, i.e., in programmer mode it shows green "Service Mode SPROG Programmer Is Online" and red "No Operations Mode Programmer Available".On subsequent startups it shows green "Service Mode SPROG Programmer Is Online" and green "Operations Mode Programmer Internal is Online".See attached screen shots.Can we revert to the original red/green display in all cases? The fact that the status changes after restarting is even more confusing to some users.Andrew

Hi,Using Logixs I created some automation.The JMRI Panel Editor screen will always show the correct status but the web browser (tested Chrome on PC and Safari on iOS) don't reflect all the changes properly.Using F5 or similar will show the correct situation.Any idea what can be wrong?Thanks,Jan

Hi,Not sure if this problem has already been flagged or already been resolved.On a couple of older Ubuntu machines (running 32-bit versions) we have a problem when combining the Tams MasterControl with JMRI 4.10.All looks fine but JMRI simply doesn't communicate with the command station even after after updating the preferences.Just use JMRI 4.8 and all works just fine.Any suggestions?As I'm writing this I will check if it is also related to the local settings (Dutch vs English).On Windows this is not a problem at all.Thanks,Jan

PR #5105 turned on the HTML scan of the help/en tree during Travis CI.  If there are any problems (using the same criteria as the Jenkins job), the Travis “headless static” job will fail with more info near the end of the log.If you want to execute that check before committing, use  ant scanhelpThanks for the feedback, and to Egbert Broerse for getting us to zero on these warnings so the check could be turned on.Bob

I installed on a live LCC layout. Worked fine. Didn't need to touchPreferences, so didn't notice the font search. But on my dev system I see itrunning in background for a minute or two. Very few parts seem to care (8cores I think) but Preferences does. It stays as a blank window if I find itvia the 'Windows' tab.

Steve,Nothing to do with command stations. I am running a LocoNet in stand alone mode and OpenLCB, also without any command station. This has been a issue with earlier releases as well.

Addsomething bad, get an error.   Fix it, and get a clean build.Even if the messages aren't completely clear, they point to the fact that*something* is wrong, and the committer will either research and find theissue on their own, or they can ask for help.   I don't recall anyone whoasks a question like "I'm seeing an error on build #321 and I don'tunderstand it" get shot down.   The ensuing discussion usually enlightensmore than one person.I'm of the school that says once warnings are reduced to zero, there's notolerance for additional warnings.   That's cause for pushing back on thepull request until the code is fixed.   Now, that needs to be doable withcode that's available to everyone.   It doesn't necessary have to be "easy"for everyone, but that wouldn't hurt.   Standard tool versions; standardbuild targets (no need to fiddle with obscure commands; run 'antcheck-this' or 'mvn check' should be all that's needed).Publish the standards, the tools and the expectations.   Work withcontributors to bring the code up to the level the project expects (don'tleave them hanging).    Running the tests on the pull-requests would beideal - so the results can be checked and the info available to thereviewer.

TLDR: I’d like to add the HTML scan step to CI and am looking for comments. - BobThrough the recent excellent work of Egbert Broerse (see PR #5085 and #5097), the Jenkins HTML scan is showing zero items:This is great, but it’s hard to keep these scans at low values.  The Java warnings scan, for example, seems to be in dynamic equilibrium between “new items creeping in” and “people spending time resolving them”, occasionally falling back pretty far:(At least part of the time, those Java warnings are highlighting real bugs:I’ll fix that one shortly, no problem; I put it here to show the value of having multiple kinds of scans and tests)I’d like to add the HTML scan to our CI tests and require that new PRs show zero errors to pass.  The scan takes less than 30 seconds on Jenkins, and probably similar during CI. I’d add it to one of the shorter jobs so there’s no overall delay in getting a PR checked. There will eA quick scan of the last three weeks’ PRs shows that only a small fraction (roughly 8%) of PRs even have HTML commits, and those (except for Egbert’s) typically only touch a couple files.  I doubt that anybody will introduce lots of HTML issues all at once.  But I think this is the best way of keeping one item at a time from building up to something large.On the other hand, we do want new people to feel like they can contribute things, even imperfect things.  I occasionally will correct bits of a new piece of contributed code after the fact.  Having CI fail on the original contribution makes that a bit harder, though not impossible.One possible issue is that the scan is done [1] using the Unix ‘tidy’ command [2].  That works on macOS and the two Linux versions I tried, as tidy was pre-instaleld.  Although a Windows version definitely exists, I don’t know whether it’s commonly installed; developers using Windows might have to install that as a separate step before being able to check their work.Thoughts appreciated.Bob[1] The current script (see  https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/scripts/tidy-scan.sh ) formats its output for Jenkins, so we’ll need a similar script to do a yes/no check for CI.

FWIW, the web server has special handling for panels to avoid screen scraping them; a transform of the XML is sent to the web client (its more complex than an XSLT transform), and the individual panel elements are all rendered locally on the client along with the javascript logic to allow interaction with the panel.

I realize that I am a long-time lurker here and thus perhaps don'thave much to contribute, but some thoughts here:One thing that I have had trouble with is determining what exactly allof the panel editors are for.  This has now been clarified from Bob inthat all of the editors were designed for different things.  Mysuspicion is that most other people have this problem as well.  Theywill simply try to do what they want with one of the editors and useit as they see fit.What it seems like to me is that there should really be only editor,and this editor can do all the different types of panels.  If you wantit to be for a local control panel, you simply style the paneldifferently(a la CSS).  In some ways this would also make a localcontrol panel a subset of the general panel editor.  I think the bestanalogy that I can come up with here is if you are usingWord/Powerpoint, when you create a new document you can choose atemplate.  The data in the document doesn't change, but when youchange the template the visual style changes.To Randall's point, if the GUI is properly decoupled from the data, itwould be easier to display it would make putting it into a webpagemuch easier.  If somebody was clever enough you could do an XSLTtranslation on the XML for the panel and have it display automaticallyin the web, as opposed to the screen-scrape like thing that is therenow.  (For the record, I don't actually know how to do XSLT, but Iknow that it is possible).  This would actually be a very nice thingfor my club layout, as we want to put in soft panels to have localcontrol.  The actual software needed would only have to be a webbrowser at that point in order to properly implement the panels.To Randall's last point, although it may be easier to completely re-dothe code, it may be a good idea to try and switch over everything thatis possible automatically, since otherwise you would have 4 editors atonce.  https://xkcd.com/927/-Robert MiddletonOn Tue, Mar 13, 2018 at 8:43 PM, Randall Wood<randall.h.wood@...> wrote:> I would love to see the Editors decoupled from their displays (all of them> really), so that a headless JMRI instance could display a panel in a web> server.>> I tried about three years to begin that, but after about six months gave up> on it—this was before we switched to git, and there was strong and vocal> opposition to doing the separation.>> So yes, disentangling model from view is of long term benefit, and is hard> (see how hard it is turning out to be even for the WiThrottle), although it> may be, at this point, easier to start over from scratch than to modify> existing code.>> Randall Wood>> On Mar 13, 2018, at 19:37, Bob Jacobsen <jacobsen@...> wrote:>> Maybe time to revisit a discussion about how/whether to focus/unfocus Layout> Editor.>> As a reminder:  When David Duchamp wrote the basics of layout editor, it> _wasn’t_ intended to be something that would be used to run a railroad.

How do we place something on the panel that is controlling a turnout output,but is not a turnout? In this case it is a set of relays that control thepower for staging tracks. So I want to use a status lamp type display toshow which are powered on. But while we can change icons for sensors veryeasily, it is not obvious how to do that with a turnout object. I know Icould use Logix or Routes and create a sensor that follows the turnout, butis that really the best way? I can also just go into the xml and edit whichicons are used, but I like to think if there is something I need to do,other users might have the same idea but not be able to edit xml.What do others think of this?-Ken Cameron, Member JMRI Dev Team http://www.jmri.org http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org http://www.cnymod.com http://www.syracusemodelrr.org

Hi KenI think it is a cut and paste error. It is normal to do the mappings for  the most capable mast (in this case the triple head), then copy and paste  it in to the lesser masts making appropriate changes for the aspects that  cannot be displayed. In this case it looks like the entries for Medium  speed have not been removed or modified on the double head mast.The only 'Medium' aspects that can be displayed on the double head mast  are Medium Approach, Medium Clear, and Approach Medium. In practice a  double head mast would not be used when signalling medium speed in to  medium speed so the error should not be seen, but it is nice to have a  catch mapping that will display something useful in the event of misuse of  a double head mast or a block speed error.Suzie x

There’s an element there that refers to the sensor table, something like:       <table xmlns="" name="jmri.jmrit.beantable.SensorTableAction:Internal">            <columns>                <column hidden="false" name="Comment" order="3" width="194"/>                <column hidden="true" name="Active Delay" order="8" width="75"/>                <column hidden="false" name="User Name" order="1" width="194"/>                <column hidden="false" name="State" order="2" width="88"/>                <column hidden="false" name="Inverted" order="5" width="62"/>                <column hidden="true" name="InActive Delay" order="9" width="75"/>                <column hidden="true" name="Use Global Delay" order="7" width="75"/>                <column hidden="false" name="System Name" order="0" width="74"/>            </columns>            <sortOrder>                <sortKey column="0" sortOrder="ASCENDING"/>            </sortOrder>        </table>except the “sortKey” element is causing a problem.

Things like Your Favorite Office Suite can usually safe a document as either paper format or for the web, but it gets tricky to have them both look good.There are more complicated tools that take a single version of a document and then render that various ways, but they’re not particular simple.I think it would be fine if you wrote some html pages that were both in JMRI (on web and in the help; those are actually the same files see http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/Help.shtml )I’d be happy to help you change the Header.shtml, Footer.shtml and Style.shtml include files and CSS that (most) JMRI help pages use to draw the decorations: Having different versions of those on your web site would allow you to use the same MyPage.shtml and have it look different.And linking is certainly fine.Bob> On Mar 11, 2018, at 11:27 AM, Andrew Crosland via Jmri-developers <jmri-developers@...> wrote:> > Can anyone recommend any tools or work flows that would help manufacturers, i.e.me :), to minimise duplication of effort in maintaining> - Product documentation> - Own web site> - JMRI Help pages (on-line and in the software)> > Free and lightweight would be ideal :)> > Would it be acceptable to link to the JMRI website as the authoritative source, assuming I bring that up to date?> > Andrew> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------> Check out the vibrant tech community on one of the world's most> engaging tech sites, Slashdot.org! http://sdm.link/slashdot_______________________________________________> Jmri-developers mailing list> Jmri-developers@...> https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jmri-developers--Bob Jacobsenjacobsen@... +1-510-708-5988 AIM, Skype JacobsenRG

Ken,Glad you are involved with this one.My interest in helping Ted was looking at the CMRI connection possibly causing the problem.  I wanted to verify if CMRI was the culprit, I could address the issue.  The Arduino environment is an UNO and Ted uses the CMRI.cpp sketch.  An initial node address problem was corrected early in the testing.  The CMRI serial side seems to be OK.Initial back and forth discussion (off list) was related to confirming the connections and table data, and trying to duplicate the problem on my system.Ted sent me a copy of his xml panel file and I ran it under 4.10 and 4.11.3. There was one issue with the Powerline connection which I disabled.  Otherwise the tables, including the Sensor table showed up normally and I could see traffic in the serial monitor.  I'm running on OSX, he is on Windows.I made a panel with just two sensors and one CMRI node.  I sent that to him to try with the added request to disable all of the connections except CMRI.  The most recent test was to open the sensor table using the Startup preference, this apparently worked as the sensor table was displayed.  I am not sure if Ted was able to run a test with just a CMRI connection.That is where we left the testing as of this morning.  Ted will be out of town next week.The debug path I was on was to isolate the comm environment to just CMRI to see if the sensor table appeared.  There are two additional connections, Loconet and Powerline, which have sensors assigned.  The CMRI only environment worked, then adding each of the other connections back in might shed some light on this.With all of the updates which have been applied to his system environment, the problem might be mixed and matched files in the JMRI directory or the OS.  I noticed in one of the log files that JMRI is running out of Program Files (x86).I am available to continue to help out on this.Thanks,Chuck CataniaOn Mar 11, 2018, at 7:18 PM, Ken Cameron wrote:> Anybody have a clue on this one?

Thanks Suzie, the layout this is for can ignore it for now. Not all of thesignals are installed yet. But since I run into a lot of these things, Iwanted to understand better. So the key you are saying is the 2 head filehas it asking for M-A-M, but that same file is saying it has no way todisplay that. That is the line for:<ourAspect>Medium Approach Medium</ourAspect>While there is no line supporting that aspect. So the error message. Iwonder if this was a cut/paste type error or was M-A-M meant to be one ofthe other aspects this signal could display?-Ken Cameron, Member JMRI Dev Team http://www.jmri.org http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org http://www.cnymod.com http://www.syracusemodelrr.org

Hi KenYes playing with the speeds will let you try a lot of things. Setting the  speeds to 'Medium' will display the error. It requires the route after the  signal mast to be 'Medium' speed, and the next mast to be showing a  'Medium' speed aspect. If you have a triple head mast you will see the  Medium Approach Medium aspect displayed fine, but a double head mast will  error because of the incorrect mapping to a non-existent appearance.I will try and get the mapping for the double head mast resolved but I am  a bit short of time at the moment to work on it and test it properly.Suzie x> Message: 1> Date: Sun, 11 Mar 2018 09:01:00 -0400> From: "Ken Cameron" <kcameron@...>> To: "'Discussions between JMRI developers'"> 	<jmri-developers@...>> Subject: Re: [Jmri-developers] NS-2008 calls for Medium Approach> 	Medium, but mast is only two heads> Message-ID: <124601d3b939$02dfeb60$089fc220$@twcny.rr.com>> Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii">> Suzie,>> I have my little test setup now.

Suzie,I have my little test setup now. Yes in my case the path is known to beclear, so restricting isn't good. On my test I'm not seeing the M-A-M but Ionly modeled a couple of blocks for the test. The panel is using allInternal. I manually set the two right hand signals to clear. The sensorsare for the blocks. This let me focus on the signals and what combined forwhat. But I'm thinking it picked restricting because the default speed forturnouts is restricting.

Ken,Take a look at the Options >> Turnout Options >> Turnout Circle Size.This value is also used for click detection of other track objects, such as track segments and anchor points.When the size is large, the click area for the anchor points can cover a small track segment which results in an anchor point context menu.  This will also impact track segments that connect two turnouts.Dave Sand> On Mar 10, 2018, at 8:55 PM, Ken Cameron <kcameron@...> wrote:> > I had to go through the 'unblocked track' to find them.

There are quite a few scenarios in the signal systems where a mast cannot  show a suitable distant aspect for the next mast - on the prototype they  would have chosen the correct mast of course, but we cannot stop modellers  putting any old mast in as a distant, and this can happen quite a lot on  modular layouts where slightly mismatched modules are joined together.  When I create a system I try and put in a suitable mapping for every  possible scenario so even if there is a mismatched pair of masts something  other than stop will be displayed that will convey some useful information  to the driver which is usually of a more restrictive nature. Don't think  that because you have a triple head mast you can show every distant  aspect, this is especially true of speed systems where often a medium mast  cannot show a distant for limited or vice versa - NS-2008 does not have an  aspect for medium approach limited or limited approach medium, or even  limited approach limited.The error shown is due to an error in the mapping for the double head mast  where there is a mapping entry telling it to display the medium approach  medium aspect which it can't do because this is a triple head aspect (red  over yellow over green). This is one of those scenarios where there should  be a fix, in this case I would probably map to medium approach (red over  flashing yellow) as the next best choice, but some modellers might prefer  a different aspect. I did have a little play with the mappings on this  mast, but they do need a slightly more thorough tidy up to get rid of the  errors when strange pairings occur.Having approach displayed in advance of restricting is a common fix when  the mast cannot show approach restricting (usually a double head aspect),  but it is not unreasonable because the line may be blocked immediately  after the signal showing restricting and stop may be required - if the  block is known to be clear something other than restricting should be  displayed because under restricting you need to assume the line is blocked  unless you can see otherwise with your own eyes.Some of the systems still have incomplete mappings so mappings are only  present for the more common aspects, with the others leading to a stop  aspect on the distant mast (requiring a flag or radio override from the  signalman in the tower).Suzie x>> Message: 1> Date: Thu, 8 Mar 2018 11:40:15 -0500> From: "Ken Cameron" <kcameron@...>> To: "'Discussions between JMRI developers'"> 	<jmri-developers@...>> Subject: [Jmri-developers] NS-2008 calls for Medium Approach Medium,> 	but mast is only two heads> Message-ID: <0d5101d3b6fc$24679ba0$6d36d2e0$@twcny.rr.com>> Content-Type: text/plain;	charset="us-ascii">> I suspect the rules would have made the railroad install a three head  > mast> at the location.

Hi:Somewhere between the 4.8 and 4.10 release of JMRI a major modification was made to the withrottle software.

This race condition occurs because directly after the UserInterface calls the FacelessServer routine to set up the listener port, it calls the ZeroConf register routine without waiting for the port to actually be created.

I found this while playing with the defaultspeed for turnouts on the diverging route. The issue was how far out thetrains would get less than clear before getting to a double end stagingyard.

Drew,Thanks for the info on the smart home infrastructure.  You also pointed outseveral reasons why I'm not really considering publishing this app.Keeping it in my sandbox and playing with it on my home layout is onething.  Providing a robust solution that is secure, flexible, and doesn'tbreak my bank hosting a cloud service is an entirely different matter.Based on my experience so far, I really don't think Alexa would be wellsuited to controlling locomotives.  It seems to be fine enough (if evenjust as a novelty) for things like turnouts, routes, maybe querying trackoccupancy or giving voice control to dispatcher activities, but as youpointed out, there's too much latency and too many possibilities of errorsfor a real-time control application.  I'm not sure I'd even consider "goingthere" based on what I know so far.I *might* *might* *might* consider cooking up an Alexa-specific interfacefor JMRI (maybe just in my own personal fork) to enable some differentcapabilities from the WiThrottle interface, but that's pretty low priorityand I really should spend what time I have available for JMRI on fixing upDCC++ and VSDecoder before I go adding yet another half-baked feature.Still it's been a fun project!- MarkOn Tue, Mar 6, 2018 at 9:08 AM Drew H <thejadedmonkey@...> wrote:> Gmail was having problems connecting to the sourceforge server.

Alas, hiding the icon column does nothing for the loading speed. It stilltakes the same minutes processing regardless of if they are displayed ornot.Regardless of the chatter about sizes, I think the key problem is how itlocks the UI for all parts of JMRI until this finishes. Which way it getsfixed, smaller files or not, is what I hope we can figure out. Getting ridof these cases where doing one thing in JMRI locks you from using otherparts of JMRI is a bad thing. I hope nobody thinks otherwise.-ken c

Randall,I suspect that it is not uncommon for users to have multiple displays with varying DPI values - especially for those of us who would rather spend our limited funds on models rather than on computer technology.For example, I have a relatively-modern laptop computer with display of about 172 dpi, connected to an old secondary (something)-VGA monitor at about 100 dpi.  I have various JMRI windows placed on each display, with no JMRI window "crossing" the boundary between displays.  Yes, one must carefully craft panels and choose font sizes, and/or one must live with poor display utilization and/or deal with readability issues.Regards,Bob M.

From: Randall Wood <randall.h.wood@al...> - 2018-03-05 02:08:25
You don’t have fixed sizes for images in JMRI; different versions of Java on different OSes may render differently.  As of JDK 9 for Windows and Linux, and JDK 8 for macOS, the pixel size of an image may not match the logical pixel size of its frame, because the image will be rendered at pixels matching the display DPi, while the frame’s pixel size is the logical DPi. This means that an image in a 32x32 logical pixel frame needs to be 32x32 pixels for one monitor, but may need to be 64x64 or even 96x96 on another monitor. Note that this is a per-monitor problem; however if we assume that most users with multiple monitors use monitors with similar DPi on a single computer (it’s really difficult not to if only because of how text changes between to monitors with different DPi), the problem then becomes one of making sure we get the 32x32 image sized correctly for the computer, which is easy to cache locally and reuse; whereas having a single 32x32 in a profile that must be shared puts us in a position where we cannot trust the image to be scaled correctly.Randall WoodAlexandria Softwarerandall.h.wood@...http://alexandriasoftware.com> On Mar 4, 2018, at 20:38, Ken Cameron <kcameron@...> wrote:> > Randall,> > Right now there are three places that have finite sizes for the image: icon,> list page lower left, media page in roster entry.

Dave,On my system the original files (5M) take about 8-12 minutes for the rosterlisting page to open. If I use a copy that has the small files (30k), it isabout 8-15 seconds. So the amount of time is significant with 600 entries(about 450 had images). The user's system takes more like 15-20 minutes forthe roster list page to come up.But during that time, JMRI stops interacting on all screens.-Ken Cameron, Member JMRI Dev Team http://www.jmri.org http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org http://www.cnymod.com http://www.syracusemodelrr.org

The reason we cache locally is that different computers have different constraints; a R-Pi Zero will need to resize more aggressively than an iMac, and even different generations of iMacs may behave very differently.As for your not being able to read an engine number in a photograph; that may be a factor of that particular photograph, and really cannot make a judgement call in the RosterEntry class how the image, when requested, will be used; that image may be requested for display at a large size on an iPad (modern iPads have a max pixel size and native resolution that was unheard of in consumer computers not even five years ago); it may be requested for display in a table at some very small size.Data sync services are very good about syncing once unless the item to is removed or replaced; you don’t need to worry about that; we do however need to worry about caching across a network, especially is we are going to cache at multiple sizes—how do we deconflict that, or avoid spamming a computer that is part of the Dropbox syncing, but doesn’t really have the fast drive to deal with lots of unwanted files?Randall WoodAlexandria Softwarerandall.h.wood@...http://alexandriasoftware.com> On Mar 4, 2018, at 19:18, Ken Cameron <kcameron@...> wrote:> > Bob J,> > I was wondering about the memory too.

But when a user drags an image to the Media panes, we don't actually move or use the original user-provided image. We create our own copy for use in the "roster" folder, so I wouldn't feel too bad about transforming the image as we create our copy.My DAM software creates a thumbnail of every image I drag/import to it (although it stores the within the catalogue file rather than in a folder) and likewise doesn't touch the original.But there's the issue of retrospectively transforming existing images in the roster folder.What are the CPU/elapsed time overheads of an in-memory transform of every image every time we open JMRI?Sent from my iPad-- DaveThe New England Convention 2018http://www.newenglandmodelrailwayclub.com/content/convention.shtml> On 4 Mar 2018, at 11:26 PM, Randall Wood <randall.h.wood@...> wrote:> > That said, we *can* do an in-memory transform to the correct pixel size (we do this in the web server), so we are not retaining the full image in memory (we don’t do image editing, so don’t need to retain the original), but I would not want to manage the image the user provided.

Randall,I would say the right place IS the roster folder because it would be syncedwith other systems. Why force the distribution network to keep sending backand forth lots of big files when the smaller ones would work fine.Bob J,One thing I think that would be worth mentioning to users is theconsideration of the file size and impact on performance. Mentioning theview in the roster is only a X by Y view, having pictures of higherresolution doesn't help. So I'm leaning to at least a warning on the rostermedia page based on the image size on that page.-Ken Cameron, Member JMRI Dev Team http://www.jmri.org http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org http://www.cnymod.com http://www.syracusemodelrr.org

We display this *at the size* a web client requests. We can’t scale up; only down, so we can’t replace the user’s images. There is nothing wrong with caching images (so long as the cached images are stored in a cache, not in a profile folder that may be expensively synced around), but the original cannot be lost. The roster table is not the only place using roster images.Randall WoodAlexandria Softwarerandall.h.wood@...http://alexandriasoftware.com> On Mar 4, 2018, at 17:43, Ken Cameron <kcameron@...> wrote:> > Randall,> > The problem is we are doing an in memory transform, each and every time.> > The biggest argument for why we resize is the windows we display it in.

It’s more complicated than that.First, it’s not the transform that showed up in the trace, it was the load.Java loads images asynchronously, which is good.  But when the render request comes in, which is intrinsically on the AWT thread, it doesn’t have a good way to defer waiting for the load to complete unless it knows the image metrics (size, mostly) already.  And providing that before the load is complete is complicated: It’d involve saving the information from a _prior_ run.There are other possibilities, like writing a renderer that knows to redraw when the image is complete, in the process perhaps changing the layout of the display, or perhaps being smarter about a fixed layout, or probably lots of things.  I can’t think of one that’s not going to be difficult to get right, though of course that doesn’t mean one doesn’t exist.Next, there’s the problem that Java does not normally drop loaded images from memory.  You’d have to write something that managed, and if need be reloaded, those. That’d involve some careful redo of the JMRI code, because a retained reference (of which there seem to be quite a few) would cause problems.  Maybe a handle-based approach would help? Or maybe not.After that, there might be a problem with related transforms.  Not sure I see that yet, but if it’s there, it also has to be solved or it’ll make the above two solutions pointless.Maybe somebody will get interested in digging into some of that code and building something that does the right thing. It’s not a high priority for me:  I don’t see a need to spend days on tricky code to save one user (admittedly a club) maybe 20 minutes of reformatting images.  But somebody else might have a different set of priorities.Bob> On Mar 4, 2018, at 2:43 PM, Ken Cameron <kcameron@...> wrote:> > Randall,> > The problem is we are doing an in memory transform, each and every time.> > The biggest argument for why we resize is the windows we display it in.

Can you see where the PARKed thread is waiting?AFAIK, a thread has to park itself, it can’t be parked by anything outside itself.  The java.concurrent classes use that as a lighter-weight form of collaborative synchronization, as it’s just cheaper than a true lock.  So I suspect that you’ve _something_ _else_ that’s waiting before it proceeds, which is causing some other part of a java.concurrent class to be hung up.I.e. if you can see where the TrafficController thread is in PARK, see if that’s inside some java.concurrent object, and look for _other_ uses of that object that have been held.Bob> On Mar 4, 2018, at 10:14 AM, Andrew Crosland <andrew@...> wrote:> > I am still trying to figure out performance issues with the SPROG soft command station causing packets to not get to the rails as often as they should.> > It's mostly working well now and I don't see any particular issues on my Windows desktop.> > The real problem occurs on an Raspberry Pi.

Our tables do not support any bulk actions at all, so claiming these check boxes support that is a straw man argument. That said, individual actions taken on individual sensors is, by definition, not bulk anyway.Putting individual per-object buttons in columns do not change that. Providing users with duplicate, indistinguishable columns (when given two OpenLCB connections) that are always enabled (even for the wrong connection) and show no indication of not acting when a user clicks on them (other than stack traces) because there are multiple connections is being actively hostile to users. Providing users with enabled, but non-responsive controls in columns for non-OpenLCB connections is also just a bad UI.These columns need to be fixed both in the sense that they throw errors and they are poor UI.Randall Wood> On Mar 1, 2018, at 00:41, Balazs Racz <balazs.racz@...> wrote:> > Ken,> > almost all the columns can be switched on and off in the footer.

Not all users are familiar with how to resize images. The same problem can be seen on web forums there some users have problems with images that are to big to post on the forum.A solution could be to add some code to automatic resize new images to the roster. And if that code was added, it would also be nice to be able to run that code on existing images in the roster.RegardsDaniel2018-03-04 04:30 skrev Bob Jacobsen:> Java images are (by default) loaded into memory and kept there.> > So 1.8GB of roster pictures is going to be a problem until somebody> makes the JMRI code in that area _much_ smarter.> > But the real problem is the 5Mb (which is probably 5MB) pictures.

Right. I think actually *being* the dispatcher presumes a level of AI thatis beyond my skill level. And probably unnecessary anyway.More like Alexa is the human dispatchers voice interface to JMRIs tools andalso the “radio” for voice- called OS and things like that.I think we are on the same page with that, I just may not be using theright words.I agree the test assistant would be a great use.Biggest problem is dealing with AWS access to JMRI through a dynamic IP.May need some kind of cloud layout registry service to make that workoutside of the sandbox.

Thanks. I agree the way the wait may stall the AWT thread is not good. I don't know why it was written that way but I think it goes back to the very first SPROG support. I had always assumed there was other similar code but I don't see any other 'waitForReply' variables. It probably worked OK when SPROG was just a programmer. The soft command station has been causing a few headaches recently.There is a comment "Updated January 2010 for gnu io (RXTX) - Andrew Berridge.  * Removed Runnable implementation and methods for it."Maybe there was originally a separate thread.Can I get the pre-RXTX form Git, or does it predate our use of Git?I think I do need to use a queue to accept asynchronous messages from various sources and fire them off to the hardware one at a time with a strict message/reply pairing.Andrew------ Original Message ------From: "Bob Jacobsen" <jacobsen@...>To: "Andrew Crosland" <andrew@...>; "Discussions between JMRI developers" <jmri-developers@...>Sent: 01/03/2018 18:35:08Subject: Re: [Jmri-developers] Help needed with synchronized method>‘wait(..)” drops the lock (you’ll see it called a “monitor” in some >places).

‘wait(..)” drops the lock (you’ll see it called a “monitor” in some places).  That’s intentional. The wait/notify are meant to go together, working cooperatively.  So they’re meant to be coded together.`synchronized` isn’t a good way to hold something off for a long time.  It’s really meant to make sure individual methods don’t overlap, not long operations.  For example, if synchronized kept the AWT thread from advancing in the example below, effectively freezing it in place, that’s probably not the desired outcome.Many of the TrafficManagers use a producer/consumer approach, where there’s a quick synchronize operation to put messages on a queue, and a thread that takes things off it.  The notify() operation then makes sure the reading thread is awake to look at it.Bob> On Mar 1, 2018, at 10:20 AM, Andrew Crosland <andrew@...> wrote:> > The SPROG traffic controller has a synchronized method to send t the hardware:> >     public synchronized void sendSprogMessage(SprogMessage m, SprogListener replyTo) {> >         log.debug("Entering sendSprogMessage()");>         if (waitingForReply) {>             try {>                 log.debug("Waiting for a reply");>                 wait(100); // Will wait until notify()ed or 100ms timeout>             } catch (InterruptedException e) {>                 log.debug("waitingForReply interrupted");>             }>         }>         log.debug("Setting waitingForReply");>         waitingForReply = true;> >         log.debug("sendSprogMessage message: [{}] id: {}", m.toString(isSIIBootMode()), m.getId());>         // remember who sent this> //        log.debug("Updating last sender {}");>         lastSender = replyTo;>         lastId = m.getId();>         // notify all _other_ listeners>         notifyMessage(m, replyTo);>         this.sendSprogMessage(m);>     }> > The wait(100) is terminated by a notify when a reply is despatched:>     private void sendreply() {>         //send the reply>         log.debug("dispatch reply of length {}", this.reply.getNumDataElements());>         {>             final SprogReply thisReply = this.reply;>             final SprogListener thisLastSender = this.lastSender;>             final int thisLastId = this.lastId;>             if (unsolicited) {>                 log.debug("Unsolicited Reply");>                 thisReply.setUnsolicited();>             }>             // Insert the id>             thisReply.setId(thisLastId);>             final SprogTrafficController thisTC = this;>             thisTC.notifyReply(thisReply, thisLastSender);>         }> >         // Do this after reply is despatched to avoid this.reply and .lastSender>         // being overwritten by a new reply>         synchronized (this) {>             log.debug("Clearing waitingForReply");>             waitingForReply = false;>             notify();>         }>         >         //Create a new reply, ready to be filled>         this.reply = new SprogReply();>     }> > notifyReply() used to be called from a runnable but I don't want it to run on the swing thread, so now call it directly.> > The problem is that two threads are executing the synchronized code> > >>>slot thread sets waitForReply:> 2018-03-01 17:54:32,763 sprog.SprogTrafficController          DEBUG - Entering sendSprogMessage() [SPROG slot thread]> 2018-03-01 17:54:32,763 sprog.SprogTrafficController          DEBUG - Setting waitingForReply [SPROG slot thread]> 2018-03-01 17:54:32,765 sprog.SprogTrafficController          DEBUG - sendSprogMessage message: [O 01 3F 8C B2] id: 17124 [SPROG slot thread]> 2018-03-01 17:54:32,768 sprog.SprogTrafficController          DEBUG - sendSprogMessage written to ostream [SPROG slot thread]> > >>>slot thread has exited the synchronized method.

Hi,  I was wondering if there is any way to turn on the scrollbars when not inedit mode for a panel created in the panel editor? There are times when thepanel is dragged from the right to make it half the screen it is sized forbut without the scrollbars you can not get to the other part of the screen.Is there something to set or is this a feature that just ain't there?=gerry=

Mark,I was thinking more of it being a junior dispatcher and the senior givingthe major directions. Then the software would take it from there. But the2nd person testing support is a big one for me. Your mention of withDispatcher gives a way for the 'just in time' updating of train locations torelease cars for other trains. Some layouts use a traffic manager position,usually next to the dispatcher. They would interact with Dispatcher toupdate and generate the switch lists on the fly.-Ken Cameron, Member JMRI Dev Team http://www.jmri.org http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org http://www.cnymod.com http://www.syracusemodelrr.org

That's a very good point, Ken.It also occurs to me that with the right connections to JMRI (poss. throughthe existing web server interface?) one could issue commands toDispatcherPro and OperationsPro as well, effectively turning Alexa into avirtual Dispatcher.-MarkOn Thu, Mar 1, 2018 at 12:21 AM Ken Cameron <kcameron@...> wrote:> Mark,>> That's something that might be handy when debugging a layout.

Ken,almost all the columns can be switched on and off in the footer. If youdon't like a column or set of columns, switch it off. I think columns canalso individually be hidden by right clicking the table header.The table format is useful when you have to do a bulk operation over alarge number of objects, or you recognize there has been some inconsistencyin how you set up your objects and need to find the outliers for yourselfto fix. Needing to go "edit", then find the tab, click the tab header,check-double-check, click inside if wrong, type new value, then hit save isquite a bit more painful. You are accustomed to doing a bunch of stuff bydirectly opening the XML so it's not an issue for you.For system-specific properties, they can be edited in the generic"properties" tab of the edit dialog.thanks,BalazsOn Thu, Mar 1, 2018 at 4:24 AM, Ken Cameron <kcameron@...> wrote:> My other view on this is what we should bother having as columns in the> first place and what to leave for the 'edit' display.

i think those columns will duplicate and that's the problem. Specificallythe difficulty is who creates the renderer for the column.- if the columns come from the different connections that are from the samesystem, then presumably they will have the same renderer. But they mightstill have a different renderer instance. If we use different columns, wecan use the specific renderer from the systemconnection, but will clash onthe column's internal name. Also this is a weird user experience.- if we want to share the column, what do we do about the renderer? Thecolumn name will be fine though. Also if there happens to be two differentsystems with the same column name, now we're in trouble because we'lldefinitely be using the wrong renderer.On Wed, Feb 28, 2018 at 1:37 PM, Randall Wood <randall.h.wood@...> wrote:> If you have multiple LCC connections are table columns duplicated that> should not be?>> Randall Wood>> On Feb 28, 2018, at 07:27, Ken Cameron <kcameron@...> wrote:>> Balazs,>> I did remove the 2nd LCC connection and the messages went away.

I am all for abandoning SourceForge.For the services we use SourceForge for:- Release Distribution: I think we can simply stop posting new releases to SourceForge and begin directing everyone to use the GitHub releases.- Web Site: I would like to move the web site from SF.net <http://sf.net/>;, but also would like to make its content static (this has an advantage for JMRI users—everything that relies on PHP (except the bug reporting tool) is shipped with JMRI, but neither the JMRI help viewer or web server can render PHP or SSI) so it can be hosted anywhere, not just anywhere that supports Apache HTTPD with a PHP module. I’ll follow up with a separate more concrete proposal on how we could do that.- Mailing Lists: There some scripts on github for migrating from mailman to Google Groups. I am all for using one of these to retain the mailing list archives from SourceForge within Google Groups, but am not adverse to using other services (but do not want to use Yahoo either).Randall Wood> On Feb 17, 2018, at 14:55, Bob Jacobsen <jacobsen@...> wrote:> > SourceForge.net will eventually come back up and make our web site available, though there’s no way to estimate when.

I guess an important question is what the meaning of the 'system specific'column are and what they do.But on first try with 4.11.3, I'm getting cases of clicking in the sensortable and seeing nothing in the monitor nor action happening on the nodes.So I'm guessing it is an interaction that I'm needing details. Since thereis no help mentioning the extra columns (at least from the 'window help'),I'm not sure where to find the explanation.I also see that the fields for 'pullup' show in the 'edit' panes (but thesystem specific columns do not show in there), but show on many connectiondevices that don't have a clue about pull-ups. I think part of this isunrelated to LCC, but is more a complaint about inconsistent datapresentation.Shouldn't everything about an object that you can change be in the 'edit'pane? It seems some things are showing in the columns only and that seemscontrary to how we usually did things.-Ken Cameron, Member JMRI Dev Team http://www.jmri.org http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org http://www.cnymod.com http://www.syracusemodelrr.org

Hi,Would suggest that in the various panel editors it is possible to also select which font is used.At this moment it looks like Tahoma is being used in JMRI 4.10.In older panels this seems to be Tahoma Bold.Is to silly to have to revert to editing the XML file, which a normal user will not want or be able to do anyway.Best regards,Jan

Ken,you asked about this on Feb 18 titled "4.11.3 error messages". I replied tothat asking for some clarification but have not received a reply from you:"""These columns are the ones I added in 4.11.2; can you check if you get thesame errors when you open the same profile in 4.11.2? There might besomething in the profile as well to trigger this problem, it seems you havemore than one OpenLCB connection, which could be a culprit for example.Afaik saving table state means the order of columns and how wide they are,but I have no idea what a column "identity" is.

Hi all,Sorry for putting anyone on the wrong leg.I just checked and the Pipo had locale settings Dutch and the laptop English.I changed the locale on the Pipo to English and also use JMRI 4.10 and now the Logix works on the Pipo as well.The moment I change the locale again to Dutch the Logix stops working.When in locale Dutch and you edit the logix it will throw an error related to the logical condition.It says (R1 and R2) and (R3 or R4) and the error it throws is related to it.I know the first part doesn't really need to be between brackets.Hope this helps in trying to find the root cause of the bug.Best regards,JanOn 25/02/2018 21:41, Jan Boen wrote:> Hi all,>> I developed quite some Logix under JMRI 4.8 and this worked perfectly > on my laptop (Intel I7) as well as on my Pipo X9 (Z3736F, Windows 10, > 2GB RAM).> I upgraded both laptop and Pipo X9 to JMRI 4.10.> On the laptop all works perfectly alas on the Pipo X9 the Logix > doesn't work properly any more.> I will gladly share the XML file with you.> What happens is that as part of a Logix at the end of the execution an > internal sensor (RESET) is set to the state active.> This state triggers another logix which then resets a lot of internal > sensors to inactive.> On the Pipo X9 the RESET internal sensor is not set which then stops > the proper execution.> At the same time on the Pipo X9 I have the impression that certain > other elements in the Logix aren't properly working any more.

Hi all,I developed quite some Logix under JMRI 4.8 and this worked perfectly on my laptop (Intel I7) as well as on my Pipo X9 (Z3736F, Windows 10, 2GB RAM).I upgraded both laptop and Pipo X9 to JMRI 4.10.On the laptop all works perfectly alas on the Pipo X9 the Logix doesn't work properly any more.I will gladly share the XML file with you.What happens is that as part of a Logix at the end of the execution an internal sensor (RESET) is set to the state active.This state triggers another logix which then resets a lot of internal sensors to inactive.On the Pipo X9 the RESET internal sensor is not set which then stops the proper execution.At the same time on the Pipo X9 I have the impression that certain other elements in the Logix aren't properly working any more. Can't tell for sure yet.I tried downgrading to 4.8 on the Pipo X9 but alas the XML won't load any more as new attributes (i.e. font) have been added in the XML whereby the XML no longer loads in 4.8.Any short term fix would be highly welcome as my layout is due to participate at an event shortly and I have to train some operators in the next couple of weeks.Thanks,Jan

When I have a LCC type layout I've got two issues:1. If I have no other layout connection, the 'Defaults' are all Internal. Iget the warning about that's not right, but in this case it is.

(To determine this I manually edited several panel files and re-ordered elements in arrays. I then loaded and re-saved the panel files. In all cases the shared objects reverted to lexical order and the non-shared objects maintained creation order).Based on this conclusion my suggestion would be for shared objects to be shared in alphanumeric order (to make manual editing easier when necessary).2) Blocks are saved twice: once with minimal information and then again with full information. This is so that all blocks will be created (by the first (minimal) block object) before the full block objects are loaded that contain path information that may depend on other blocks (that may not have been created otherwise).I fixed this quite a while back by having the block (xml) loading code load in two passes: on the 1st pass it just creates the block objects (with minimal information) and on the 2nd pass updates those block objects (by loading all information).I didn't change the saving code at that time; it's still saving all blocks twice as before. I did test to see if not saving the minimal block elements would break the load and it did not.Given the other xml schema changes (that break current panel files from loading on older JMRI's) it should be safe to modify the block saving code to eliminate the 1st pass (that saves the minimal blocks).-- Enjoy,George WarnereMail, Message, or FaceTime: <geowar1@...>

It was quite a while at first before I noticed the order stayed (like 2 or 3years). I had presumed it would generate the save in whatever order it usedand wasn't related to the load.

AFAIK, we don’t actually need to write the groups twice anymore. Now that Logic Conditionals are properly local, we could just write groups once and process that one group twice.

You may want to look at what code has already been changed between 4.10 and4.11.4+.

Dick,So my take on the identify report will be correct for direct input/outputpins. But the alt pins will not report the current state of the toggle.Using the pushbutton example, it would report invalid, when the button isthen pushed after that report, it would produce the events for the nextstate. So sometimes an external user would have figured the toggle to be'off' but the next event sent would be another off event. So anything tryingto trigger from the toggle going from on to off, it would miss thistransition if it using its internal on to off transition (I'm thinking likeJMRI Logix). Instead if the trigger was figuring on 'I got the off event, itmust have been on, then it would consider correctly. But any internal logicthat was relying on a state machine following the toggle, it would be wronguntil the next time the pin was pressed.The conclusion would be that a toggle input is not worth using the identifyinformation. A toggle would be been better off with an unknown answerinstead of valid or invalid in this case. So any state machine trying toreplicate the state of the toggle should be written to ignore the identifyinformation and remain unknown until the first event comes in.Or did I miss something in how this would work? I'm not seeing it as a bigissue, but one that designers would need to keep in mind.-Ken Cameron, Member JMRI Dev Team http://www.jmri.org http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org http://www.cnymod.com http://www.syracusemodelrr.org

You have to set the engine, release it and set it again to get the command station to recognize the set command.I do not want to put the test release up on our club track, because I am the only member that has a clue about programming and how the software actually works.ThanksBob

Ken,Just got this e-mail. We have decided to always check the actual input line. In the case of an alternate action button, this means that if it is not active, then the report will be 'invalid' even when the node remembers what it was last. However if the input line itself is active, then it will report as 'valid'. This allows alt action lines to be mixed with momentary lines. Of course there needs to be some local visual feedback in that case.Dick :)On 02/18/2018 08:21 PM, Ken Cameron wrote:> I think one the issue with this is if the P/C is a simple input/output or if> it is a state machine.

I think one the issue with this is if the P/C is a simple input/output or ifit is a state machine. A single input line, closed or open as the values, itwould see the current state of the line and report valid/invalidaccordingly. The state is based on the current voltage on the pin. For anoutput, same idea, is the circuit currently driving or not driving theoutput. But if something is doing more than that, example would be a single linepushbutton supporting an alt-type output (push once, ON, push again, OFF),then you have a state machine and it would have to consider the currentstate for the identify messages. You would never get a report based on thestatus of the input itself, you would always hear from the state machine.The state machine would have the valid/invalid or unknown if it has notinitialized.Now if the state machine is not part of the input (or output) circuit, thenit has its own events to consider for the outputs and I'm not so sure aboutit identifying its inputs. While it would know which input was the lastevent received, if any of the inputs were currently reporting unknown, wouldthat alter what it should reply?So to me is seems we don't have a blanket here, we have to consider how eachis configured. So back to an example of RR-CirKits Signal-LCC board. For anoutput, it knows if the output is on or off, so it can respond accuratelyfor those events. An input pin, will have to know the mode it is operatingand then knows if the raw pin state is meaningful or if the toggle state ismeaningful. For a signal mast, it would use the matching state machine(since the outputs may be blinking) for responding. Now a logic cell, that'stricky, only if it thought all the inputs were considered not unknown couldit then say one way of the other, any doubts would be unknown as the answer.The above seems to break in to two classes of objects.

Ken,We will have to agree to disagree on this one.We seem to have  jumped from discussing :- Sort order in JmriBeanComboBox, where objects like Sensor Names have a regular pattern.Sorting a long list of this nature for typeahead preselection makes good sense.To:- Sort order for enumVal ComboBoxes in decoder definitions, where item names are usually locale-specific words/phrases with no regular pattern.Forcibly sorting a relatively short list of this nature for typeahead preselection has little benefit and may well destroy any functional grouping or other order considered important by the definition creator.The former I heartily concur with, the latter I consider inappropriate and strongly object to.Sent from my iPad-- Dave> On 20 Feb 2018, at 12:33 PM, Ken Cameron <kcameron@...> wrote:> > If the values were translated (due to locale) then the sort should also be> following the locale.

The sort order chosen by ESU for its software and manuals is based roughly on descending likelihood of use. An alphabetic sort would also be very language-specific in this case (do you choose English, German...?), unlike turnout tables, etc.Sent from my iPad-- Dave in Australia> On 17 Feb 2018, at 12:32 AM, Ken Cameron <kcameron@...> wrote:> > I would have thought that for user convenience having them sorted would make> finding the feature easier.

4.11.3 test version has substantially improved this issue.  I gather from the notes that its thanks to Randall for the improvements. On the Windows 7 machine that was previously taking 1 minute to get to the PanelPro screen, it is now around 5 or 6 seconds.  Which is back in the realm of "sensible" for this particular machine.    (Reasonably fast hardware with a SSD for the operating system and applications.)Once the PanelPro screen is present, I can use the menus, open tables, start commands, etc. as I would expect.    I've carried out any tests against a layout.  - Nigel-----Original Message-----From: Ken Cameron [mailto:kcameron@...] Sent: 09 February 2018 22:41To: 'Discussions between JMRI developers'Subject: Re: [Jmri-developers] Slow JMRI startupIf other font in the preference, you get the default until the font list finishes loading, then it switches to the new font.

Answering in a slightly different order:*) Is there anything in JMRI that responds to invalid? (Late edit: Balazs just replied about Turnouts, but I haven’t had time to work that through)  There’s nothing in OlcbSignalMast that responds to a ProducerIdentified or ConsumerIdentified with “invalid”. Those messages don’t identify a state to which to transition.  Since the OlcbSignalMast is (trying to) track a state, it doesn’t have reason to react to “invalid”.But that’s not to say that there will never be something that reacts to that.  There certainly could be.*) hardware doesn’t know about button vs switch:  Well, maybe.  This is more Turnout control that SignalMasts, but consider the case of a turnout (the email below used a lamp, but it’s similar) connected to a switch on a single input vs connected to two buttons on two separate inputs, perhaps on separate nodes.  Those really are different.The place where invalid/valid/unknown starts to have multiple options is when there’s more than a 1-1 connection.  If you have one input line, with two Producers for “input on” and “input off”, and one output line, with two Consumers for “output on” and “output off”, _and_ _nothing_ _else_, then it’s simple:  The input controls the output 100%, each Producer is either valid or invalid, never unknown, and the startup is clear:  Consumers pay attention to the (one and only) Producer of their event.  Done.This simplicity comes from two things, both critical:  (a) outside logic ensures that exactly one of those Producers drives the output state at a time:  The switch can only be one way, and (except while changing), it’s always one way; (b) There’s exactly one Producer that matters for each output state.If you want to be able to relax those conditions, so you can e.g. have a bunch of buttons around that do various things (select a path through a ladder; set the turnouts to main vs siding vs industry track; have some buttons set up complete paths and others just control one turnout) then you _don’t_ have those (a) and (b) conditions.  That’s when invalid matters.Example:  Two momentary pushbuttons in two places that set a turnout diverging vs normal. Each button appears on an input line, but the (a) condition is not met.  How do you configure the control system to know these are not two separate slide switches that behave as above, completely controlling?  (If they were, which one would control if they conflict?)  You can set the “input line inactive” Producer to an EventID nobody cares about, so the “input active” Producer on one button fires a Consumer that sets normal and the “input active” on the other fires a Consumer that sets diverging; the “input inactive” Producers don’t fire a Consumer that does anything.  OK, but what should valid/invalid/unknown do on those four Producers?(I’m leaving that as a question, because I’ve been over this so many times that presenting the answer clearly isn’t working. Maybe it’s time to switch to teacher mode: It’s not about what I say, it’s about what the reader learns. Maybe having the reader think it through would have more impact)Bob> On Feb 16, 2018, at 5:49 AM, Dick Bronson <dick@...> wrote:> > Bob,> I am still unclear on a point or two.> > First our hardware does not know if it is connected to a button or a switch.

SourceForge.net will eventually come back up and make our web site available, though there’s no way to estimate when.  They’re historical record is that they have a day-scale problem about once a year.Is it time to move away from relying on them?The two remaining services they host are:*) This mailing list, along with a couple others:  https://sourceforge.net/p/jmri/mailman/   We could probably find another place to host those lists, perhaps Google groups or some other site.  There are some costs to moving: there’s a little bit of automation that would have to change, people might have to adjust their mail filters, and I doubt we could transfer the archive.  On the other hand, this is one of the core ways JMRI is coordinated, it it’s a pain to have to work around an outage.*) The web site (which has received the most attention this week)  By itself, it’s a pretty standard site. Steve Rawlinson has kindly provided a temporary server that’s hosting it now.  But a more permanent move would require quite a bit of adjustment:  Setting up Jenkins to automatically update a different server, adding redirects on SF.net (so that Google doesn’t keep directing traffic to the old aliases), updating links (they should say jmri org, not jmri.sf.org, but not all do), changing text in various places, other things I haven’t thought of, etc.We could run two independent sites, in case one went down, on the jmri.org and jmri.net domains.  That might be more tricky than it’s worth, however. Thoughts?Bob--Bob Jacobsenjacobsen@... +1-510-708-5988 AIM, Skype JacobsenRG

Right. Completely understood, right way for it to be.  But it makes it less of a good example of a long combo box for e.g. Sensor names, as those are sorted by name.  The best example is your approach of loading a long file, and then getting the editor to show those as a regular JComboBox.Once SourceForge is back up so I can send the announcement email for JMRI 4.11.3, the next step will be to PR some changes in this area.Bob> On Feb 15, 2018, at 11:05 PM, Dave Heap <dgheap@...> wrote:> > That's because in this case the entries are internationally in numeric value order, as per the ESU manuals and LokProgrammer software.> > Dave> > On 14 February 2018 at 16:48, Bob Jacobsen <jacobsen@...> wrote:> > I was looking at the LokSound V4.0, because I happened to have that up for something else.

Bob,I am still unclear on a point or two.First our hardware does not know if it is connected to a button or a switch. You indicate in '2)' below that the proper button responses should be 'Valid' or 'Unknown' based on the current 'pressed' or 'unpressed' situation. Would that be OK for a toggle switch as well?My second related question is about 'Invalid'.

There was a notice that we (Bob J) had to make sure the DNSrecords changed at the same time to reflect the move.-Ken Cameron, Member JMRI Dev Team http://www.jmri.org http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org http://www.cnymod.com http://www.syracusemodelrr.org

I think the point that Bob makes is that within JMRI we may end up needing a'State Machine' object. As he says the signal mast puts a number of eventstogether and has the concept of a one of N active events (with N-1 inactiveevents). As the description covers, our JMRI concept of a sensor MAY be asimple two state machine. If it is, then it too would know which (ifinitialized) is valid. On the other hand, if it was just acting like thepushbutton primitive, it would only be active while being pushed. Anotherexample for this would be the three position direction switch on the classicdispatching panel. That handle can be up, left, or right. Each would beequal to an event. But the individual event wouldn't know what the otherswere last doing. But the state machine for the direction switch would knowwhich was the last position and which is the 'valid' event.So I see this bringing up the idea of state which hasn't been given a lot ofthought so far. I think it is going to be critical to the successful use ofLCC for systems. But I think it might expose some of the 'holes' in ourunderstanding of how events can be used with great success.-Ken Cameron, Member JMRI Dev Team http://www.jmri.org http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org http://www.cnymod.com http://www.syracusemodelrr.org

TL;DR: if the customer has problems, upgrade to 4.11.2 or later, if thatfixed the problems, do not read on. I fixed a bug in my code based on Bob'sdocumentation; that fix hit in 4.11.2.Here is the decision tree for Turnouts and Sensors (warning: it'scomplicated)Turnouts that are in "DIRECT" feedback mode completely ignore all messagesthat come from the layout.Turnouts that are in "MONITORING" mode behave the same way as Sensors.Producer and Consumer identified are always treated as the same.>From now on I assume we're talking about a Turnout message where the eventid == Thrown (all others are symmetric) and the turnout is in MONITORINGmode with default settings.> On Feb 15, 2018, at 9:00 AM, Dick Bronson <dick@...> wrote:> >> > Hi,> > There is an ongoing off-line discussion on how OpenLCB Producer> Identified and Consumer Identified responses do or should work.

Dave,I would have thought that for user convenience having them sorted would makefinding the feature easier. But then I ask, would a hover  text be able totell the user what the underlying value was? That way if you needed to knowabout the 14th item it would tell you which is which, but the display orderwould normally show the human sensible order which is usually a lexicalsort.

Ken I believe that possibly the best use for JMRI with respect to DMX is to useJMRI to queue an external DMX controller for the desired theatrical effects.The variation of scripted scenarios available from even the cheapest andvery elementary DMX controller box is far beyond what might reasonably beadded to JMRI.  I believe a JMRI connection is of value, but the higherlevel DMX commands might be left to the existing and relatively cheapcontroller hardware.  Virtually all the controllers have adequate scenecreation support software.  I am working on variable color temperatureambient lighting in conjunction with time of day, mood, and weather specialtheatrical effects. The necessary DMX lighting scenarios will reside the in controller and berequested by JMRI.  The common time line is yet to be decided, but may becontained in a MIDI file.  There is currently an elementary DMX JMRIconnection tied to the light table.

From: Bob Jacobsen <jacobsen@ma...> - 2018-02-16 06:13:37
I don’t know the current answer for Turnouts and Sensors; the relevant code has been modified since I last worked on it in detail. For the OlcbSignalHead, received (1) PCEventID messages, and (2) ConsumerIdentified and ProducerIdentified messages with “valid” will set the state machine to the related aspect.  (Note that even when JMRI produces an aspect eventID, it is the _reception_ of that PCEventID message that causes the state machine update) That will in turn trigger internal updates in JMRI, which icons, table entry, etc should follow; no OpenLCB messages should be directly emitted by that process but others might follow from activated signal logic, etc.  The Producers and Consumers associated with that signal head will follow the state of the signal head:  Once it’s initialized (internally or externally), the Producer and Consumer for the current aspect will reply valid if queried and the rest will reply invalid.  Until it’s initialized, they all reply unknown.Not sure what “If so, how?” is asking. Code, maybe?  c.f. https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/java/src/jmri/jmrix/openlcb/OlcbSignalMast.java#L312Note that those are the right answers for a signal head, which is implementing a common distributed state machine.  For such a thing, "multiple () conflicting Identified messages” only arise from a misconfigured system, typically multiple _unsynchronized_ controllers.  So that right answer to “Is the order … relevant” the answer is “Yes:  Make sure that its externally controlled to do what you want it to do”.Turnouts and Sensors should be doing a similar thing with their state. Once the web site comes back up, check the Javadoc for OlcbTurnout; there’s a figure there that (IIRC) shows the intended behavior, but I don’t know the status of the code.Now, beyond JMRI OlcbSignalHead, to talk about the general case:  If you configure a _system_ in which each participating part is _NOT_ aware of the entire state, then they should be set up to know that they don’t know.Consider two momentary buttons that control a lamp on/off. There are multiple approaches to choose from:1)  The two button nodes could track the _entire_ state.  Each could listen to the other, and together agree who was pressed last and what the overall state is.  In that case, they could certainly reply with valid and invalid to represent that state.  Test for the reader:  What should they say when one is pressed and the other not?  Neither pressed?  Both pressed? Hint:  It’s a _state_; it has to be remembered.2) They could understand that they don’t have the entire state.  Then, they don’t know any _state_, just status.   So each “pressed” Producer is valid while pressed, unknown while not pressed.  (The “unpressed” Producer, if it exists, is similar: valid if unpressed, unknown while pressed.)  If neither button is pressed, neither knows the state:  Only the lamp knows.  Seems reasonable, no? If both buttons are pressed, the state is inconsistent (“Don’t do that”), and again only the lamp knows for sure whether it’s on or not. Again, that’s reasonable.3) They could be set up to represent _separate_ states for button 1, button 2 and the lamp if you really wanted to know in detail What’s Happening Right Now; this can also be useful if one button commands lots of different things to happen semi-independently.  (Technically, this is called “multiple weakly-coupled state machines”) Then each button returns valid/invalid based on the local condition, as does the lamp:  Check which node sent the ConsumerIdentified message to know what the valid/invalid means.Bottom line:  There is _no_ _single_ _desirable_ behavior for Producer/Consumer Identified valid/invalid/unknown.  They are a _capability_ to be used when setting up the distributed control system.  Different uses will use them differently.

Hi,There is an ongoing off-line discussion on how OpenLCB Producer Identified and Consumer Identified responses do or should work. The main issue relates to what happens when multiple locations have push button controls, and what happens when there are multiple copies of JMRI running.I think the key questions that need answers from the JMRI developers are:1) Does a Producer Identified valid or invalid *message* modify a Consumer (icon/table) *state* in JMRI? If so, how?2) Does a Producer Identified valid or invalid *message* modify a Producer (icon/table) *state* in JMRI? If so, how?3) Does a Consumer Identified valid or invalid *message* modify a Consumer (icon/table) *state* in JMRI? If so, how?4) Does a Consumer Identified valid or invalid *message* modify a Producer (icon/table) *state* in JMRI? If so, how?5) Is the order in which multiple but possibly conflicting Identified messages are received *for the same event* relevant for (1), (2), (3) and (4)?The current Tower-LCC and Signal-LCC initialization behavior for an input line is:a) When true, the event associated with true will report Producer Identified valid and the event associated with false will report Producer Identified invalid.b) When false, the event associated with true will report Producer Identified invalid and the event associated with false will report Producer Identified valid.The issue is that a line connected to a push button will normally respond as 'b)'. The question is; "how does JMRI respond to this, if at all"?Dick :)

Since I work with sensible naming conventions, I know the name> for the object before I start.The "broken" behavior is caused by making the combo box editable (not by any of my (highlighting) modifications);This turns on a text field where text can be entered directly instead of requiring the user to choose an item from the drop down list. Unfortunately this also causes the text field to consume the keyboard events that would normally be sent to the drop down list to allow quicker navigation there.There are several solutions; each with their own pros and cons:1) Don't make the text box editable. Pros: regain alphanumeric navigation of drop down list; cons: loose ability to directly type in names.2) Make it so that when the drop down list is opened the combo box forwards keystrokes to it instead of the text box (Move keyboard focus).	Pros: you regain "normal" (non-editable combo box) behavior; cons: may be non-trivial to implement.3) Rewrite the drop down list building code to only show entries that contain the string typed in the text field.	Pros: Narrows the choices for large layouts with lots of turnouts. Cons: Users may not realize why (non-matchings) turnouts aren't being listed in the drop down list.Options 1 and 3 have pretty big cons leaving option 2 as the lesser of 3 evils and what I'd recommend.YOMV. ;-)-- Enjoy,George WarnereMail, Message, or FaceTime: <geowar1@...>

Bob J,I guess I missed that in the earlier messages. But can you give a specificexample of a decoder to try. Any of the ones I've tried they only seem tonote the first couple of chars and then seem lost. I was trying loksound andsoundtraxx and any of the combo boxes didn't seem to do well by typing.My comment about a scrolling list being useless for large layouts was fromthe turnout example. If you've got 50-100 turnouts and another 1000 for thesignal lamps, that is a really long list.-ken c

Here is a good demonstration of non-editable combo box actions. 1. Use David Park's SensorLoad.xml 2. Go to *Tools >> Logix* 3. Select *Options >> Use Combo Name Boxes* 4. Create a new Logix and Conditional 5. Select *Add State Variable* 6. Select *Sensor* 7. In the name field type *wm* 8. Hit the down arrowOn my 13" MBA, the list is positioned at the first *WM...* entry andshows the next 50 entries.  Now I can use the arrow keys to move tothe desired row and press enter or use the mouse to click on thedesired row.The text based positioning is not case sensitive.

There might be some who prefer as it is. I don’t use Layout Editor much, and haven’t watched a lot of people do it.  But there’s already been a couple of confused threads on jmriusers, so there’s a range of preferences.  The most vocal were people who _didn’t_ want to go to the table to copy and paste, which the lack of pre-typing in the existing code pretty much forces for longer names. We could conceivably create a new Bean if somebody typed a suitable name into a editable JComboBox. Although there are various issues with that, creating a none-of-the-above entry is what editable JComboBoxes are for.  But that’s not at all what the existing code does. Instead it is using an editable JComboBox as a funky form of navigation; that’s not what editable JComboBox is for, and the evidence is that that’s just confusing to people.I’m not sure how we got here. Perhaps it was due to confusion about how a selector (e.g. a JComboBox) is intended to work: sometimes people create custom UI elements because they don’t get the coherent picture of how the existing one are supposed to work, but custom elements due to that are rarely an actual improvement.In any case, the problem we _have_ to solve is to create an input method (probably, but doesn’t have to be, a JComboBox form) that uses a shared data model.  Layouts that have i.e. 100 turnouts (rare, but not non-existant) can’t have 400 copies of entire named bean lists and try to update them every time somebody scrolls the screen.

I have been doing a lot of research and the "revert" recommendation is not exactly right.  The layout editor fields moved from plain text fields to "editable" combo boxes.   There might be some push back on moving to non-editable combo boxes.Based on other comments and research, my understanding is that an editable combo box is text field with an attached list.  As such, text input goes to the text field.  Selecting an item from the list copies that item to the text field.

I agree.  I’ve started working on this.The basic approach:*) Create a new NamedBeanComboBox<E extends NamedBean> class that provides the JComboBox, with a dedicated NamedBeanComboBoxModel<E extends NamedBean> class that works with the correct manager.*) Deprecate, but leave in place, the existing JmriBeanComboBox class to give an easier migration path.*) Start migrating each use from JmriBeanComboBox to NamedBeanComboBox one place at a time.As to the length part:  That’s one of the things that’s not-completely-right in JmriBeanComboBox: It doesn’t entirely listen to changes in the underlying list of NamedBeans from the manager.  Getting that right in the data model is one of the reasons for a custom one.

Hi:Put up the 4.10 distribution on our club machine about a week ago and have been having problems with connecting to the withrottle server with both engine driver and withrottle.  The Withrottle panel will going into a pending state or takes a long time to get out of the Pending state when it first comes up.  It was such a problem that I have downgraded the JMRI on that machine to the 4.6 distribution and it works fine.  We did have it at the 4.8 distribution and did not notice a problem.  Went to 4.6 because that was the distribution kit that I had on the machine ( machine not on internet, and wifi hot spots are just too dam slow to download a distribution on).  Will try and get a 4.8 distribution back on it this week.While I still had 4.10 on the machine, I would check the listener for new connections with netstat and when it would not connect the listener was gone.  No other errors logged to the console, or displayed on the withrottle server panel --  Sometime it would show pending, sometime not when this happened. Since this problem was brought to my attention by a phone call from members that wanted to run on Saturday, I did not have the time to turn on the debugging to see what other information I could gather.My question to the group is-- has anyone else seen this problem?  Is it a known problem and is there a solution for it other than staying at 4.8.  Host is a window 10 machine with patches current as of the middle of Jan.  Have not had time to bring machine home and get this months patches for the OS.Bob

If you typo'd when entering a turnout name then when you tried to create said turnout on the layout you'd get an error that that turnout didn't exist. Likewise if you typo'd when entering a block name then it would gladly create a new block with that name for you… even if that's not what you wanted.Pretty quickly I learned to open the turnout table view; copy the user name for the turnout from that; switch back to the Layout Editor view and paste the name into the text field. Most of the JMRI users that I communicated with at that time said that that is how they used the Layout Editor text fields (and IIRC the JMRI doc's actually do it this way as well).I thought "we can do better". How about we change that to a popup menu? Well that would work ok for the turnouts (since it only accepts existing turnouts) but what about blocks? The user needs to be able to ether select an existing block from a list or enter a name to create a new block. Playing around with JMRI I know that I'd ran into places where the UI did exactly that… which lead me to the JmriBeanComboBox (which is a sub-class of JComboBox).Here's the description of a JComboBox from the Oracle tutorials page for JComboBox's (<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/combobox.html>;):[BEGIN]A JComboBox <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/JComboBox.html>;, which lets the user choose one of several choices, can have two very different forms. The default form is the uneditable combo box, which features a button and a drop-down list of values. The second form, called the editable combo box, features a text field with a small button abutting it. The user can type a value in the text field or click the button to display a drop-down list. [...]Combo boxes require little screen space, and their editable (text field) form is useful for letting the user quickly choose a value without limiting the user to the displayed values. [END]Note the bold text in the last sentence. That's what's needed to input the name for something that doesn't already exist (IOW: Not in the (drop down) list of valid values).All well and good… so I put in some time and changed all the text fields to editable JmriBeanComboBoxes… Note: I was tempted to have all the text fields that only worked with existing objects just use the drop down list however this would have broken users workflow that were accustomed to the cut-and-paste method that I described above. Backwards compatibility being an absolute I decided to not go that route and use the combo boxes instead. Experienced JMRI users could continue to using the cut-n-paste method or the drop down lists. New users would probably just use the dropdown lists.Note: There's a misconception that the text field text is used to narrow the choices displayed or jump to an entry in the drop down list. This is not true. The text field text has no effect on the drop down list contents or selection. The only interaction between the two is that when you select an item in the drop down list it is copied into the text field. That's it. (Note: with non-editable combo boxes you can type characters and the drop down list will jump to an appropriate selection in the list; this doesn't work with editable combo boxes. (Personally I believe this to be a bug.))Life was… better. Except that you had no way of knowing if the name in the text field was valid: did it describe an existing object? Or would it create a new object?So I wrote the code to set the text fields background color based on if the object exists or not. For objects that had to exist (like turnouts) if it didn't I'd color the background red; for objects that didn't have to exist (like blocks) if it didn't exist it would color the background yellow. In both cases if the object existed I'd color the background green. If the text field were empty I'd set the background color to white.Ok, wrote the code; submitted the PR; got it merged… and life (with JMRI) was… better.Sometime later (after using JMRI a lot more) I wondered: Is there a way to know which turnouts are already being used (so I wouldn't get that annoying dialog telling me it was already in use)? My first thought was that I'd just eliminate the ones being used from the list… an Ok idea except for one thing: I could see users not understanding why a turnout they wanted to use was't in the list (not knowing I was hiding the used ones). Not the user experience I believed users wanted. So instead (after a bit of research) I found a way to highlight the items in the drop down list: I made the items already being used red and the available items green. This required a custom renderer.Originally as much as possible most of this code was implemented in the Layout Editor (since I didn't want to mess up any JmriBeanComboBox usages elsewhere.) but eventually I figured out how to make all the new behaviors opt-in. (IOW if specific parameters weren't set then you didn't get the new behavior.) I then moved all the new code into the JmriComboBox implementation. This should mean that the JmriBeanComboBoxes in the Table views should not be using any of the new "features".That's it. If anyone has any follow up questions please feel free to ask (publicly via this list or private directly to me is ok also).-- Enjoy,George WarnereMail, Message, or FaceTime: <geowar1@...>

The “start typing and it would narrow down” has been a standard part of JComboBoxes since (at least) 2006.  It happens automatically.

Not sure I understand the point being made.There are lots of places where a particular NamedBean (i.e. a Sensor) needs to be _selected_.  That includes Layout Editor, some columns of tables, the speedometer, etc. The JmriBeanComboBox is one way to do that. In it’s current implementation, there are modes where you can “edit”, in the sense of updating your typing, the name you’re entering, but it’s not editing the name of the bean itself.I think JmriBeanComboBox should be moved back to just the usual selection process of a combo box, just picking from already existing items, without all the other cruft.  But perhaps there’s a good reason for it to be kept, and if so I’d like to hear it. That’s this thread.There are other places where it’s useful to be able to directly enter something , without having to go to the Table to predefine.  The Turnout Tool (not Table) for example should be able to make simple cases simple by just entering a number for a turnout address.  So we should _also_ have a JmriBeanTextField that does that. (We have most of the parts, it just needs to be assembled)  Plus java/src/jmri/util/swing/BeanSelectCreatePanel.java and PickListModel.sensorPickModelInstance() and probably other solutions that already exist.There’s a lot of simplification work that could be done in this area.  I’m just proposing to try to (first) get some reasonable code in place for JmriBeanComboBox’s GUI and then (second) fix the performance problems it causes.

Maybe we need to rethink how we control the editing of NamedBeans altogether—some are edited using non-modal dialogs (possibly even multiple ones), and some are edited inline in the tables. I think it would be better all around (more consistent for users, lighter weight on resources, simpler to program) to only allow the NamedBean state or value (depending on the NamedBean type) to be edited inline in the tables, with everything else edited in a separate non-modal dialog.This would solve the problems of this combo box in tables by eliminating it, but also allow someone editing a panel to directly add the NamedBean they need (the dialog can be opened).Randall Wood> On Feb 11, 2018, at 17:41, Bob Jacobsen <jacobsen@...> wrote:> > > >> On Feb 11, 2018, at 12:58 PM, dcc2 <dcc2@...> wrote:>> >> The irregular behaviour as a tablecelleditor is not unique to the JmriBeanComboBox.

I’m updating the JmriBeanComboBox class, and I don’t understand why it appears to the user as it does.I’m going to use Layout Editor for the first few examples here, but they’re used in lots of places:  to select a Sensor for Turnout feedback in the Turnout Table, etc.I’m using this set of Sensors (from Sensor Table) in the example.  Note it’s a mix of ones with and without user names.When I go to the Layout Editor, select Sensor Icon, I get a blank field:If I click in the down-arrow, it becomes a combobox selector:That works in the usual way: You click on an existing one to select it.  Two comments in passing:* As set here, the JmriBeanComboBox is showing the “Display Name”, which is user name if it has one, system name otherwise; it can also be configured to just show system names, or to show both user and system names in either order separated by a dash:   “First - IS101” or “IS101 - First”.* Let’s set aside for now the sorting order.But note that text field:  You can click in it and type.The background color indicates that there’s no match to what you’ve typed.  Note that this is not about a _possible_ name:  If I type IS400 here, which is a valid name for a non-yet-exsting Sensor, it’s not accepted.  But I can type e.g. “Second” (one of the choices above). It’ll show red background until the last key:That’s now the selected value, even if I don’t hit Enter.It seems (but the code is convoluted enough that I can’t be sure) that you can only successfully select an item in the list this way. It’s clear you can’t create a new Sensor, but there’s more than that: JmriBeanComboBox allows you to “exclude” some Sensors from the list, and you can’t type the name of an excluded one.You can type either the system name or user name of an entry in the field.  If I know that “Second” is “IS102”, I can type that:The IS102 stays in the text field, but isn’t selected in the combobox selector, which is confusing (this generated a jmriusers thread a while back).The presence of that text box means that the usual keyboard accelerator for comboboxes does _not_ work:  I can’t open the selector, type “Th”, and go to that entry.The JmriBeanComboBox class has a couple other features around changing the color coding for the validation (red vs yellow), and for adding a blank entry.  The Turnout Table shows another mode for JmriBeanComboBox, which is used in the columns for selecting feedback sensors:The initial state is blank.  If you click on the arrow to get the combobox, there’s an empty row at the top:This now works differently. I _can’t_ type directly into the text field; clicking into the blank space in the column also pops the selector.  That blank is apparently indicating that nothing is selected (OK), but the user experience ends up different: I can’t type in a specific value.  I can sort-of type in to help navigate, but it doesn’t work consistently (this is a bug in the JmriBeanComboBox implementation, which would be complex to fix, but it doesn’t seem impossible)There’s also problems with specific Looks&Feels with this code.  If I use the macOS L&F (the usual on Mac) and select a turnout feedback sensor via the drop-down, it doesn’t show up afterwards on the line until I click on it again.  (I think I see the cause of this, which is spread between the cell renderer, the cell editor, and the JmriBeanComboBox; it’s going to be a pain to fix with the current structure)—This is a lot of complicated & brittle code in a lot of places. It doesn’t work consistently with other selections. It’s inconsistent with both Java and macOS user interaction guidelines (which is another way of saying the same thing). It doesn’t even work self-consistently:  See the @Ignored tests in PR#4882.I agree that we should have a single combobox class for handling NamedBean selection.  We need that to hold shared lists of items which solves the ordering issue in one place, handles the performance issues we’re seeing (#4848). I’m happy to work on that.But I think that this non-standard GUI behavior is not desirable.So what am I missing?  Why not set this back to the standard combobox selection behavior?Bob--Bob Jacobsenjacobsen@... +1-510-708-5988 AIM, Skype JacobsenRG

I've also noticed that if you have any icons on a panel from the signals orpanels, it will catalog ALL of the possible ones before you get the mainmenu. So I think this is similar to what was happening with all the fonts,something waiting in the main for the cataloging to finish. So this threadis to discuss some of the what, how, why, and what we should consider doingabout it.I'm bringing it here first because I see it as an example of how we've gotourselves going downhill. Way back when, the code was written to build theseindexes and catalogs to save time later. But we (or outside parties) maykeep adding to the lists so those ideas that had a 10 or 50 items to indexway back when, they now have 100 or 500 items, and it adds up. Now the manysignal sets, these we kind of hope will keep growing as more rule sets arefound and added. Sets of graphics for different styles of panels, again tobetter fit the users we may make new sets. One gotcha is that many timesthese items are made by copying an existing set and making a few changes.But that does cause growth to those lists that get processed very quickly tovery long and slow.Now again we have the issue where we are slowing down the start for allusers by processing things, before the start, that most users are not using.For the icons and signals, I could see doing that for the ones in use, butthe rest should be done later, if ever, depending on what you do. I think weneed to do some considering of things like these as our current methods willonly make things worse as we grow the system. The other consideration wouldbe consideration of caching some of that similar to the slower first launchof JMRI while all the jar files expanded into class files. This last one, Idon't know if it still goes on but long ago it was noticeable, but peoplelearned that only happened on the first launch after upgrade.One argument raised about why we do some of this work before the start isthat some of the code is written where doing it later may interrupt the flowof data to and from a layout. Losing data there is bad. But it is generallysign of some bit of code running in the wrong thread or not doing somethingas a separate thread. Unfortunately this seems to fall into the world ofcode maintenance and not creation. It isn't viewed with the same glamor andpraise fixing problems that had lurked since long ago and have finallyturned ugly. We need to consider that this work needs to be done sometimeand how in general we should be balancing things between processing beforethe start vs processing 'just in time' as the need (which might never) comesup.One part we must keep in mind is many of our users have limited computerswith limited resources. So the scale of these time drains may be much worsefor the average user than many of the developers. Keep in mind the threadabout WinXp still being around, our user base is rather frugal. Yes that isdragging along a dead horse, but if it (normally) does what they need, theywill want to keep plugging along with it.Now Randall is valiantly trying to improve the startup and font issue. Itimproves it in letting the main continue, but at a cost of spawning about a140 threads that all go away when it finishes building the listings for thefonts. He's been trying a number of ways and it has gone back and forthbetween still hanging during the start or taking a large jump in some otheractivity. It is showing that some of this do first vs deferred is not allthat easy.-Ken Cameron, Member JMRI Dev Team http://www.jmri.org http://www.fingerlakeslivesteamers.org http://www.cnymod.com http://www.syracusemodelrr.org

Since it seems that loading the fonts is fast but calculating if the font is mono is sometimes very slow, my question is if it is possible to cache the result of the calculation?Would a font that is monospaced ever be changed to be proportional? Or a font that is proportional ever be changed to be monospaced? If not, it would be safe to store the name of the font and the type of the font to disk. On start of JMRI, we load the fonts and the cache. If a font is not in the list, we calculate that font.Regards,Daniel2018-02-09 18:54 skrev Nigel Cliffe:> Incredibly slow to load  (My normal JMRI load time with this font> issue is 1 minute).> > Takes around 1 minute to get from blank window to displaying the first> two lines:> 63: Prepare font lists...> 58360: ...font lists built"> And then some seconds later ( might have been 20 seconds, wasn't> expecting anything, so not paying attention), I get the third line> added:> 75099: Subsequent call - no need to prepare> > > Tried it a second time, and again about 1 minute for first two lines.>  Third line well over four minutes of waiting.> 46: Prepare font lists...> 57377: ...font lists built> 262097: Subsequent call - no need to prepare> > > Third time, took an epoch, first two lines were about 1 minute> (again).

I'm doing some tests in a clean project.

Would really like a thread dump to be sure, but I think Ken’s stack trace is showing that the blocked thread is [main], not Swing/AWT. That’s consistent with the earlier comment that tables can be used, etc, while waiting through the delay for the center window to appear. Of course, any fix that defers work until later will be invoked off Swing/AWT, so has to be done carefully.

It’s not “the floating point stuff”.  It would take a _huge_ number of computations to use up a minute.I expect that the time is spent _loading_ the fonts so that each one can have each of its glyphs scanned for size.  That requires pulling every font off disk (or SDD or whatever) if there’s not meta-information that would allow a quicker answer to f.getStringBounds("W", frc).getWidth()> On Feb 9, 2018, at 7:06 AM, Ken Cameron <kcameron@...> wrote:> > From this view it would seem that if we presumed that the character fonts> were proportional, we'd be right almost every time.

If it’s guess and accept that guess is sometimes wrong, I doubt that’s OK.  Remember that the default for the console, which i use because I’ve never needed to change it (why does anybody care what the console font is?), is a mono-spaced font; that’s the most common use case.But maybe the mono-vs-propotional info doesn’t really mean anything.  What’s it used for?  Can the code scan just one font later on, when it’s selected?> On Feb 9, 2018, at 7:18 AM, Randall Wood <randall.h.wood@...> wrote:> > The only reason we do this is to get lists of fonts by attribute. It is far better to delay starting JMRI than it is to lock up JMRI in the middle of use, given that JMRI may be reading and writing to/from a layout and may interrupt control to get that list if we don’t pre-stage it.I think that’s overstated.I can’t reproduce this, and we _still_ don’t have a thread trace, but what I think is happening is:   A background thread is working to load the font info   Main initialization is asking the JmriConfigurationManager to load (an in-line call)	that works down to the individual Providers		one of which is SystemConsolePreferencesManager			which wants to setFontFamily				which stalls because it’s synchronized against the thread loading the fontsSo the questions become: What’s lost in deferring the SystemConsolePreferencesManager.setFontFamily until later? Does setFontFamily require a complete scan before the set operation is complete?We don’t actually know the answer to those yet, but I can give you two hypotheses on downstream impact:*) setFamily (but not complete scan) is needed to open the Console item from the Help menu - it can’t show that window until it’s font is known.*) The complete scan is needed to open the Console’s pane in the preferences - it wants to show the entire list.Both of those are occasional operations that can wait a bit (with or without popping an “Wait a second while I work” notice), and in most cases the background thread will be complete before they’re needed anyway. Bottom line:  Multiple people are being delayed _every_ _time_ by a noticeable amount of time (a minute?!), so long that it’s a complaint.  We should fix it right (see above).  But if we can’t fix it right, then we should minimize the impact by having people suffer that delay only when they need to because they asked for something that requires it.Bob--Bob Jacobsenjacobsen@... +1-510-708-5988 AIM, Skype JacobsenRG

There are seven messages in the thread at my machine, non from Bob.  However, over on JMRI Users, I eventually found a message on Wednesday about a “Thread Trace”.  Which has links to Java VisualVM  as something that might work for Windows.No idea what that is, the link shows some sort of application doing stuff.  If I search for it to install it from Oracle/Java, no results.  Which is then guesswork time for me.  Clearly something needed on my machine, but no idea what it is.I remain willing to help.

I started PanelPro and a Panel comes up. And I can select "Edit / Open Editor" in the Panel menu and I can select and unselect the checkboxes in the Panel Editor dialog long before the main PanelPro window appears. I might be wrong, but I don't get the impression that the event dispatch thread is locked. The GUI seems to work fine during this long period. And I'm running Windows 8.1 and is seeing the long startup time for PanelPro.Regards,Daniel2018-02-09 11:33 skrev Randall Wood:> That said, we can’t understand what is causing the delay unless> someone who experiences the delay provides a stack trace.

After the merge was done, I closed the PR and used the close and delete branch function.The Netbeans Repository browser shows under Local branches MRCS-metrics (in sync with origin/MRCS-metrics) and under Remote origin/MRCS-metrics with the same hex tag.Here is the terminal output from this AM.Last login: Sun Feb  4 11:27:21 on ttys000Chucks-MacBook-Pro:~ Development$ cd /Users/Development/mrcs-cmri/JMRIChucks-MacBook-Pro:JMRI Development$ git branch  MRCS-metrics* masterChucks-MacBook-Pro:JMRI Development$ Where I want to go from here is to merge the current Git master with my Local master, then create a new branch (MRCS-CMRI-dev1).Picking up from the gitdeveloper document, I would follow the last few commands.  This is were I left off at the start of this process.   I assume I should be in the local master branch when doing this.git checkout mastergit pullgit checkout -b MRCS-CMRI-dev1I also would like to clean up the numerous remote branch names with CCatania01, leaving CCatania01/MRCS... ones in place.  The reason for me is to make the file listing more readable.  I understand that they do not take up much space.Does this give everyone looking at my issue enough info?

Hi,  An optional suggestion: One of the ways we use to reduce the overheadcaused by GUI refresh requests was to insert a 1 second trap routine at thepoint the incoming refresh messages are received by the display updateservice routine. This trap would start a 1 second time and begin buildingan aggregated refresh request for each message that  arrived  during  thatperiod. Then at the end of 1 second it would send it on to the displayupdate service and throwaway the incoming collection it had aggregated. Ifmore were coming in, it would start another 1 second period of aggregationor if not just idle and wait for more. This really reduced the displayupdate interference and the human using the display never even noticed.Just a possible  option,=gerry=On Wed, Jan 31, 2018 at 11:38 PM, Ken Cameron <kcameron@...> wrote:> Bob,>> From that description, one place I've seen lots of activity is the sensor> and turnout table, the latter in particular if the feedback is displayed.> Normal case, the status (sensor: active/inactive, turnout: double that for> the feedback).

If a JTable implementation is coded right, the only activity is due to either changes (and most of the columns only change when the user changes them) or due to having to redraw something due to a screen layout change:  Another window moved off the table & uncovers it, or table resized or scrolled.  That should be really efficient. It doesn’t scale as N*X.But it’s possible to code the JMRI-specific part of the rendering badly, so that each small bit of activity is expensive.

If much is going on,that could be a lot of things updating all the time. The concept of the editbutton being the right choice for some items instead of adding columnsshould be kept in mind.

I don’t see that as an Error log call anywhere.  The one that’s debug-leve in 4.11.2 (the final tag) is in the loadRenderEditMaps call within an anonymous class created by makeJTable (in the TurnoutTableAction class).  It gets invoked in the rendering sequence as part of getRenderer(row, column).The getRenderer code there seems to rebuild the render maps if i.e. rendererMapSensor1.get(t) returns null (while displaying the SENSOR1COL).  Not sure why that should be happening repeatedly, though. I would have thought that was an initialization step.Bob> On Jan 31, 2018, at 7:12 AM, Balazs Racz <balazs.racz@...> wrote:> > 2018-01-31 07:10:08,565 beantable.TurnoutTableAction          ERROR - initialize for Turnout "MT02.01.57.00.00.6C.00.3C;02.01.57.00.00.6C.00.3D" Sensor "null" [AWT-EventQueue-0]--Bob Jacobsenjacobsen@... +1-510-708-5988 AIM, Skype JacobsenRG

Those have been in sort-order for a while, so I don’t think that’s the cause of the slow-down by itself.  There might be a scaling issue in the changes to AbstractProxyManager to properly handle system name strings. In particular, the getNamedBeanList() method (which underlies getSystemNameList() and getSystemNameArray() ) does a bunch of work each time it’s called.  If it’s being called for e.g. each turnout’s feedback sensors (i.e. every time) that can easily get out of hand on a large-N layout.  So you may be looking for the combination of- too much combinatoric work in getSystemNameList or similar- invoked too often in JmriBeanComboBox- which changes to the table redisplay are invoking too oftenYou might be able to find that last one with git bisect on your additions to the table; the other two were latent, and it’d be harder to disentangle them that way.I can look at the first one this weekend.  It shouldn’t be too hard to cache those results (I _think_, but haven’t confirmed, that it can listen to the underlying managers to invalidate the cache)Bob> On Jan 30, 2018, at 9:58 PM, Balazs Racz <balazs.racz@...> wrote:> > Hey,> > I have tried to use 4.11.2 at David Parks' layout and got into some serious slowness when trying to scroll in the Turnouts table.> I am attaching the XML file that produces the problem.

Usually when I am doing something like an ActionListener from a Button, I can't throw it, so I need some form of handling.Lots of places just log it, and then stop doing whatever they were attempting to do.  That’s a bit unfriendly, because somebody might be e.g. repeatedly mashing a button trying to get something to happen. Most people don’t look in the log.  But the usual causes are due to problems with input, and I guess people expect the user to eventually figure that out.	throw new JmriException("Hardware Address passed should be a number”); 	throw new JmriException("Unable to convert " + curAddress + " to a valid Hardware Address”);I’ve recently started handling similar errors as:                log.error("User Name \"{}\" is already in use", nam);                if (!GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()) {                    String msg = Bundle.getMessage("WarningUserName", new Object[]{("" + nam)});                    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, msg,                            Bundle.getMessage("WarningTitle"),                            JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE);                }                return false;(The “return false” is basically “give up and end operation”)  This handles both headless and graphical uses reasonably _but_ it’s a pain to have to create a lot of internationalized warnings (though that might be inevitable) and it’s hard to do it automatically from a JmriException that might have multiple causes.AFAIK, JmriException itself isn’t internationalized:  When you ask for getLocalizedMessage, you’re going to get the default English getMessage() text.   What might be good is something like:                log.error(“Exception: {}”, ex);                if (!GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()) {                    String msg = Bundle.getMessage("Warning", new Object[]{("" + nam)});                    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, msg,                            ex.getLocalizedMessage,                            JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE);                }                return false;(syntax not checked) then we could, as time is available (i.e. slowly), I18N the more-common "new JmriException” lines.Bob--Bob Jacobsenjacobsen@... +1-510-708-5988 AIM, Skype JacobsenRG

Sorry, misunderstood.A couple things you could do, depending on what’s needed.  If you just need the blocks, layoutblocks, etc, but not the actual graphical panel, you could remove the <LayoutEditor> element from your XML file.  If you do need to load and show the panel, you can close it after it’s no longer needed with this snippet (From java/test/jmri/jmrit/display/layoutEditor/LayoutEditorWindowTest.java, which also shows how to load a sample file):	// Find new window by name (should be more distinctive, comes from sample file)        EditorFrameOperator to = new EditorFrameOperator("My Layout");        // It's up at this point, and can be manipulated        // Ask to close window        to.closeFrameWithConfirmations();The EditorFrameOperator constructor will wait until it finds that Frame, and the proceed.  That’s what the 2nd comment means.Bob> On Jan 29, 2018, at 9:44 PM, Dave Sand <dave@...> wrote:> > There are the two LE windows left that create warnings which appears to be a common occurrence for many tests.

The in the DCCpp code, the timer actually never caused any data to be sent to either the command station or the user interface because DCCpp doesn't support the concept this is used for in the Lenz throttle.Paul

The same basic issue exists with JFCUnit (which we basically no longer use) and with the support JmriJFrame has for finding frames.This applies both to things we can control within the test (if we create something directly, we can usually name it) and to frames created by the class under test (dialogs, for example) and it really can cause a lot of test issues.Paul

I haven’t made much progress on understanding "approximately one second (for) JunitJtil.resetWindows()” because I’m not able to consistently reproduce that.  Any suggestions on where to look?I did find one occurrence of a long delay (2+ seconds) that was due to the AWT/Swing thread being locked. Unfortunately, it unlocked and ran before I thought to grab a complete dump, so I don’t know exactly what was going on. I haven’t seen it occur since.That perhaps points to a class of possible causes for delays in resetWindows():  The work of resetWindows is on the AWT/Swing thread (which is should be), so that if something constrains the AWT/Swing thread the close can be delayed.  But the problem isn’t the resetWindows, it’s whatever is constraining the thread.Bob--Bob Jacobsenjacobsen@... +1-510-708-5988 AIM, Skype JacobsenRG

I'd like to also add ahelp text to show for the ToolTip but that's hard. Since the expectation isthat these are localized, they should be coming from the Bundle of thespecific manager class, e.g. OlcbTurnoutManager.For the value, it's harder. Boolean is a simple case, because only acheckbox is needed. If we want something like a JComboBox then we're introuble, because there is no general facility today. Furthermore, it'sdifficult because the Manager from jmri.jmrix creates theNamedBeanPropertyDescriptor classes, but it's not acceptable to have swingcode in the manager to define a TableCellRenderer (btw is this statementtrue?); neither is there access cross-package to the jmti.jmrit.beantablepackage where there are some default renderers. Right now thesystem-specific column facility only works for types for which the defaultrenderer is okay (Boolean definitely and maybe Integer but I haven't tried).>> So, although I think it’s fine to _control_ the turnout with properties, I> think that the person who programs that capability should also provide an> plugin for the table that presents and allows editing (as appropriate) of> those properties.>It would be good to know some use-cases to work with; maybe we could createa few generic renderers that can adapt to those use-cases. Then we canadjust the NamedBeanPropertyDescriptor class to enable parametrizing thoserenderers.One example I've been thnking about is the Pullup/Pulldown in the Sensortable. I see this is implemented by DccPP, but is there any other system? Ithink it's weird and out of place, because other systems use the systemspecific configuration method (e.g. CVs for loconet or in openlcb the CDIconfiguration dialog) to configure things like pullup/pulldown on aper-port basis.Maybe we could migrate these to system-specific properties in order tosimplify the UI of all other systems.>> As for persistence, that’s already being done by-system, by-manager> through the ConfigureXML mechanism.

There are a couple dozen places in the code (including a couple I wrote) that treat java.util.Timer objects as throw-aways: create, have it fire, done. But they’re not like that. They’re heavyweight objects that continue to exist and expect to be given more work. They need to be cancel’d when done. But instead of doing that, it would be better to switch those calls to jmri.util.Threading calls. That centralizes their management while simplifying the code.

I may be misinterpreting what's going on, but you can see in the attached screenshot of live threads that there are some DCC4PC Sensor Poll threads that do not terminate.Then a lot of timers are created by dccpp. Looking at the heap dump they seem to be associated with dccpp throttles:"Timer-79" prio=5 tid=831 TIMED_WAITING     at java.lang.Object.wait(Native Method)     at java.util.TimerThread.mainLoop(Timer.java:552)        Local Variable: jmri.jmrix.dccpp.DCCppThrottle$1#141     at java.util.TimerThread.run(Timer.java:505)There are 140+ instances of DCCppThrottle left after all dccpp tests have finished.Andrew------ Original Message ------From: "Dave Heap" <dgheap@...>To: "Andrew Crosland" <andrew@...>; "Discussions between JMRI developers" <jmri-developers@...>Sent: 25/01/2018 19:14:34Subject: Re: [Jmri-developers] Curious test behavior - extra unneeded invocations of setup()>Screenshots can be embedded on messages to this list.>>Sent from my iPad>-->Dave>>>On 26 Jan 2018, at 4:33 AM, Andrew Crosland <andrew@...> >>wrote:>>>>I don't think I can add attachments here, but I have a few peoples >>direct e-mail addresses if a screen shot would be of interest.

These show up in the thread trace so I assume a "waiting" timer constitutes a thread.olcb creates and does not kill a *lot* of threads which are left in wait or park state. dccpp and z21 are other culprits.I don't think I can add attachments here, but I have a few peoples direct e-mail addresses if a screen shot would be of interest.Andrew

I would much rather resetWindows run on every test an log an error for any window it resets; that way it is catching tests that don’t cleanup behind themselves.

Bob J., The repeated appearance of log.warn from testShow() is a function of the unique log.warn statements I placed in my hacked test.In my log, the messages of format "time1" thru "time28" represent one of 28 log.warn statements within the testShow() method.  I intended to try to find where time was lost within that method by looking at time deltas.  There is nothing unexpected in this part of the log; the test is executed exactly once and the 28 internal log.warn messages each show up exactly once, as expected.In my log, the messages of format "test 40" thru "test 42" represent one of three log.warn statements within the testCTor() method.As such, both the testShow() method and the testCTor() method were tested exactly once.Your second concern, the resetWindows() call run time, is a valid one, not explainable by my test logging.Regards,Bob M.> -----Original Message-----> From: Bob Jacobsen [mailto:jacobsen@...]> Sent: Wednesday, January 24, 2018 5:30 PM> To: Discussions between JMRI developers <jmri-> developers@...>> Subject: Re: [Jmri-developers] Curious test behavior - extra unneeded> invocations of setup()> <snip>> I think there are two other things here that are much more interesting.> > First, why does testShow() get called so many consecutive times?

@BeforeClass is only of value if you need a computationally expensive setup once for a number of tests. @Before ensures a new setup for each test (avoiding the possibility that test B only succeeds if test A is run before it), so we need to use @Before to ensure that each test can succeed in a clean environment. (Note that maven and the Eclipse IDE can test individual methods, not just classes, with the JMRI project, so ensuring each test method has the correct setup is of value.)Paul Bender has chimed in; his comments were essentially that we don’t teardown/cleanup enough in our tests, but still leave too many artifacts in the JVM for following tests.Randall Wood> On Jan 24, 2018, at 20:39, George Warner <geowar1@...> wrote:> > On Wed, 24 Jan 2018 14:07:53 -0500, Randall Wood <randall.h.wood@... <mailto:randall.h.wood@...>> wrote:>> The setUp and tearDown between each each test is a compromise between performance and an ideal test state.
